  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The world owes much to Homeopathy—more probably,
than has ever been told, or will ever be known. It is
something to be emancipated from drugs, from lancets,
leeches, blisters and poisons; but it is more, to be relieved
from the fear of them, and to be restored and preserved
by forces mild as love, and gentle as the dews of heaven—forces
unknown and unrevealed, until elicited by the
genius of this system.</p>

<p class='c004'>But these benefits are not confined to the human species.
Animals may enjoy them as well; and heaven knows how
much they need them. For to them the day of sickness
is not merely the day of doom, but of suffering and of
torture as well. Ignorance and cruelty seem to have controlled
this branch of medicine—not that men are of
necessity careless in regard to the lives of their animals,
or designed cruel as to the measures used to restore them
when sick; but so little real knowledge prevails concerning
their diseases, and so much error as to the proper methods
of cure, that the most absurd and cruel measures almost
of necessity prevail with corresponding results. Some
judicious stock owners, taught by experience the fatality
of the common methods of treatment, notwithstanding
the torture and expense, have more humanely, if not
more wisely, abandoned all treatment, preferring to let
nature contend with disease alone, rather than with disease
and drugs united. But, thanks to Homeopathy,
there is a better way.</p>

<p class='c004'>For many years past, Homeopathy has been applied to
the diseases of all domestic animals in Europe, with the
most brilliant success. In this country, and the British
Isles, within the last few years, not only have individual
practitioners applied its remedies with equal success, but
some large veterinary institutions, and most of our principal
traveling equestrian troops and menageries, employ
it exclusively in all diseases of their horses, experience
having shown them its great value and curative power,
and its immense superiority over every other method.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>But the inherent intricacies of the system rendered its
general introduction for the cure of animals impracticable;
and though, in the hands of some practitioners and some
veterinary surgeons, it worked wonders enough to show its
astonishing capacities, yet to the masses it has remained
a sealed book.</p>

<p class='c004'>The principal of Humphreys’ Homeopathy, which has
proved so efficient in popular use, we have now applied
to the diseases of domestic animals, and, from numerous
trials, have proved it an entire success. With this Case
and Manual every owner of stock may know every ailment
among them, and can treat it successfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not among the least benefits conferred by this new
method is the ease and simplicity with which the proper
medicine is administered. No tying, bottling, struggling,
or choking are necessary. A neat little glass instrument
(the Medicator) is put into the medicine, and takes up the
requisite dose—a few drops—and at the proper moment,
is placed in the mouth of the animal and discharged; in
an instant the dose is given, and an amount of labor is
thus saved to the owner, and of suffering to the animal,
which is by no means trivial. Hundreds of animals
annually die, or are rendered valueless from disease and
drugging, that may be saved and promptly restored by
the use of the Case of Veterinary Remedies. Several of
our most experienced horsemen have given it their
unqualified commendation, and use it daily in their
establishments.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the execution of this design I have consulted every
authority and drawn upon every resource within my
reach, and the experience of each has been made to contribute
to the perfection of the whole, and all has
been combined and compared with my many years
of observation, study, and experience in the practice
of Homeopathy. We flatter ourselves that for simplicity,
completeness, and reliability it will commend
itself to the judgement of a discerning public.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Proper and enlightened attention to the wants of
Domestic Animals, is not only a sentiment of humanity,
but a dictate of economy. To know at least in good part
what is the particular ailment of an animal, and to know
also how to relieve it, would seem to be a necessary
obligation of ownership. The least we can return to the
many faithful animals given us, is to provide for their
reasonable wants, not only in health, but also in sickness
and disease. Not that every man who owns a horse,
should be necessarily a veterinary surgeon; and yet the
way is so simple that any intelligent person may readily
cure a very large proportion, nay, almost every disease
to which his animals are exposed, and yet bestow upon
the subject only a moiety of attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the many blessings that Homeopathy has
conferred upon the world, not among the least is the
immense improvement which it has effected in the treatment
of the diseases of Domestic Animals. With but
little variation, to meet their peculiar habits and susceptibilities,
the same remedies which have been so efficient
in mitigating and curing the disease of men, women and
children, have been found equally successful in arresting
the diseases to which all classes of Domestic Animals are
liable. The contrast is even greater. Probably from the
fact that treatment of sick animals has been but little
understood, and intrusted to the hands mainly of ignorant
persons, who have pursued the most crude, cruel and
destructive measures, often far more dangerous and life-destroying
than the disease itself, a large proportion of the
sick have died or been tortured to death. But when the
same diseases are subjected to the mild and benign influence
of intelligent Homeopathic treatment, it is found
that almost every disease among them is within control,
even the most fatal yielding to its magic influences.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although at first sight it may seem strange, that animals
should be successfully treated by the mild and apparently
insignificant doses of Homeopathy, yet a moment’s reflection
will suffice to give many reasons why this should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>so. Even were it not susceptible of explanation, experience
has abundantly demonstrated the fact, that animals
are, if possible, even more susceptible to Homeopathic
treatment than men, and its success in their case is even
more striking and brilliant.</p>

<p class='c004'>This may be, perhaps, attributed to their more regular
habits, confinement to the same food and drink, absence
of excitement, and freedom from the many articles of
food and drink in use among the human species, which
are more or less medicinal.</p>

<p class='c004'>Owing to these circumstances, animals are very impressible,
and the doses for them need not be so much
larger than for the human species. It seems to be a law
of nature, that the more delicate the organism, the more
subject to disease. Wild animals are almost entirely
exempt, while the highly artificial lives of some Domestic
Animals render them subject to numerous ailments and
to some very formidable diseases. Yet, as a whole, animals
are far less subject to disease than men, and far
more amendable to cure.</p>

<p class='c004'>The treatment of Domestic Animals with <span class='sc'>Homeopathic
Remedies</span>, has numerous advantages.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The medicines are given at once</span> and without trouble
or annoyance, even without taking a horse from his
team, or a cow from her stall. <span class='sc'>They produce no poisonous
or prostrating effect</span> so that the animal rallies at
once, and without loss or deterioration of value. <span class='sc'>Animals
recover much sooner</span> and hence are able to resume work
much earlier after sickness, than under any other system.
But more than all, it is far more successful. Slighter
diseases yield at once, and often from a single dose, while
the most formidable cases that are almost absolutely incurable
under old treatment, even when well conducted,
often respond to the curative influence of Humphreys’
Homeopathic Remedies, while it is well known that even
when animals recover under the old system of treatment
such have been the ravages of disease and medicine, that
their value and usefulness are generally destroyed.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='c007'>ADVANTAGES OF</span><br> Humphreys’ Veterinary Remedies<br> <span class='c007'>OVER ANY OTHER SYSTEM, OR MODE OF TREATMENT FOR STOCK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>I—Humphreys’ Veterinary Remedies, are
not an experiment.</b> They have been in use among
<span class='sc'>Farmers</span>, <span class='sc'>Breeders</span>, <span class='sc'>Livery Stable and Turfmen</span>, <span class='sc'>Horse
Railroad</span>, <span class='sc'>Express</span>, <span class='sc'>Mining</span> and <span class='sc'>Manufacturing Companies</span>,
<span class='sc'>Menageries</span> and <span class='sc'>Hippodromes</span>, and others handling
large numbers of horses and other stock, with
complete success for over sixty years.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>II—You have a remedy for any particular
Disease or Complaint. For Colic</b>, or <b>Cough</b>,
or <b>Founder</b>, or <b>Heaves</b>, or <b>Pneumonia</b>, or
<b>Indigestion</b>, or <b>Disease of the Kidneys</b>, or
<b>Urinary Passages</b>, <b>Strains</b>, or <b>Lameness</b>. You
have it in <b>compact, portable form</b>. You know
just <b>what</b> to do, and <b>how</b> to do it.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>III—Their use is free from danger to the
Animal.</b> In the usual treatment, the medicines are
either rank poisons or the most violent alteratives. It is
a common experience, that, if the horse finally lives
through the treatment he is worthless from the effects of
the medicines. Thousands of good horses are every year
killed by drugs. In <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Remedy</span> system you
are absolutely free <i>from all such danger</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>IV—They are simple. Being Remedies for
particular diseases</b> you know at once what to give.
You can scarcely make a mistake. Even if you do, you
have only lost your time, and have not killed the animal.
When using the common veterinary drugs, a mistake is
often fatal.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><b>V—They are readily and easily given.</b> You
need not lose a moment. The <span class='sc'>Remedy</span> is ready just as
you want it. With the Medicator you take the dose from
the bottle and place it upon the tongue of the animal,
without loss of time or danger. No bottling, balling,
choking, or strangling—irritating the animal and
endangering the owner or his help.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>VI—They act more quickly than any other
Medicine.</b> <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Remedies</span> act through the
medium of the nerves and the blood, rather than through
the digestive organs. They begin to act before other
medicines even reach the stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>VII—Every Ten Dollars invested in Humphreys’
Veterinary Remedies</b> will save you $100.00
and every <span class='fss'>HUNDRED</span> will save a <span class='fss'>THOUSAND IN PROPERTY</span>,
besides an equal amount in time, trouble and care.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>VIII—The saving in loss of stock is from
one-half to three-fourths.</b> This is the testimony
of hundreds of horsemen.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>IX</b>—<span class='sc'>The Treatment</span> is humane, and if we may be
humane as well as skillful, surely we should prefer it.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>X—Diagnosing the disease and giving of
medicine is</b> such, as any sensible, faithful man of
ordinary intelligence can master without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>We could annex Ten Thousand Testimonials of their efficacy.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>CAUTION</h4>

<p class='c010'>☞Take care not to confound <span class='sc'>Dr. F. Humphreys’
Veterinary Remedies</span> with the <i>spawn of imitations</i> which
the wonderful success of his <span class='sc'>Remedies</span> has warmed into
existence. Imitators have taken <i>his labels</i>, <i>his doses</i> and
<i>directions</i>, and even <i>his name</i>, under which to impose their

  <h4 class='c009'>Doses, How Much?</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is an error to suppose that animals require very large
doses of Humphreys’ Homeopathic Medicines, for experience
has shown sick animals to be very impressible, and
easily influenced by appropriate medicine, and in general,
not to require as frequent repetitions as the human
subject. Those who are accustomed to give large and
powerful doses of poisonous medicines in order to produce
some revulsive action, such as a cathartic or sudorific, or
even as an alterative, can not from hence infer the proper
quantity required when only a curative result is desired.</p>

<p class='c004'>Only experience, hence, can answer the question, How
much? And experience has amply shown that for horses
ten to fifteen drops is the range of doses best adapted in
ordinary cases, and that while cattle and hogs require
rather more, sheep and dogs require less than the
doses mentioned. We have indicated in each disease the
dose supposed to be best for that particular case, yet
to give two or five drops more in any given case would
probably not be hurtful, while to give a few drops less
would not endanger the curative action for want of the
requisite quantity. The truth is that precision in quantity
is not indispensable to a cure. The doses indicated
we think are best, but a deviation from them is by no
means fatal. One physician gives much more and another
many times less, and both are successful. Medicine
gives a curative impulse often as well or better with five
or ten drops as with more. Besides, in giving medicines
to animals, from their restlessness, dodging the head, and
other similar disturbing circumstances we can not, and
happily need not, be very positive. Give doses as near
directions, as you may be able, and the result will be satisfactory.
The best and safest rule is always to follow
directions given in book, chart, and on bottles. It is unsafe
for you to assume that you know more than the
man who made the medicine and has had many years
experience and observation in using them. Young
animals require but half as much as grown ones.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Repetitions—How often?</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The effects of Humphreys’ Homeopathic Remedies are
very prompt and positive. Often immediate, in cases of
colic or other forms of neuralgia, as the medicine acts at
once through the medium of the nervous system. In other
acute cases, such as inflammations, the effect is equally as
prompt but not so openly manifest. The medicine placed
in contact with the nervous papilla of the tongue is at
once by means of this connection conveyed over the entire
system, while the stomach being a secreting rather than
an absorbing surface, repels rather than absorbs a
medicinal influence, so that medicines act better for being
placed on the tongue than when they are introduced into
the stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>The time to repeat is when the good effect has terminated.</i>
All rules of repetition are based upon this axiom. Thus,
in colic and inflammation of the bowels, we repeat every
fifteen, thirty or sixty minutes. In inflammation of the
lungs, or chest, head, or other noble organ, or in
pneumonia or similar acute diseases, we repeat once in
two, three or four hours. In the yet less severe forms of
disease, such as Fevers, Founder, Strangles, Distemper,
Lameness, or similar diseases, a dose once in four hours,
or four times per day, is quite sufficient. While in
Coughs, Heaves, Ulcers, Eruptions, and similar affections,
if recent, a dose morning and night is ample. In old
chronic affections, a dose every day, is better than more
frequent repetitions. In most cases these Remedies continue
to act for weeks after having been given if undisturbed
by the use of other medicines.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Alternation of Remedies</h4>

<p class='c010'>In general but one medicine is required for a disease,
and it may be repeated from time to time. But cases
are often met with where two Remedies are indicated
at the same time, one to meet one phase of the
disease, and a different Remedy to meet another.
In all such cases the two medicines are given <i>alternately</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Thus give a dose of one Remedy and then, after the
proper interval give the other Remedy, and thus continue
the two <i>alternately</i>, at such intervals as the directions
demand. Nor should we be deterred from the use
of a remedy in a particular case, because the name given
it indicates a different use, for a medicine may be curative
for a particular disease, and equally so for a different or
even seemingly opposite one.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>How to Choose the Remedy</h4>

<p class='c010'>In the use of my Homeopathic Remedies nothing can
be more simple than the choice of the Remedy, while in
attempting to use the ordinary Homeopathic preparations,
the choice of the remedy is very difficult and intricate.
From an examination of the animal you will have some
idea of the nature of its disease, and will at once turn to
the Index and page in the Manual describing that and
similar diseases. Continue the search until the true
description is found, and the proper treatment pointed
out. <i>If in doubt</i> as to the particular remedy always give
A.A. It rarely fails to help, and prepares the way for
other remedies when they are required and gives you
time to think and observe. Many good practitioners
always give A.A. first. It is not necessary that all the
symptoms given should be present, as the Remedy in all
cases has a wider range of action than the disease.</p>

<p class='c004'>If a sufficient length of time has passed to clearly show
that no good has resulted, the case should be looked over
again, and a more appropriate Remedy selected.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>How to give the Remedy</h4>

<p class='c010'>Not among the least recommendations for the use of my
Homeopathic Remedies, is the ease and facility with which
they may be administered. No tying, struggling, or
choking are necessary. The animal should be approached
quietly, usually on the <span class='fss'>OFF SIDE</span> if the Medicator is to be
used, and medicine placed, if possible, upon the tongue,
well back—thence it is absorbed, and acts at once through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the medium of the nervous system. The simplest medium
of doing this is best. For this purpose the use of the
Medicator is best—a small glass instrument invented by
me. It is about five inches in length, made of firm,
heavy glass tubing (<i>see 4th cover page</i>), the lower third bent
so as to readily enter the lips. The upper end is funnel-shaped
the size of the end of the finger, and covered with
an air-tight rubber cap, so as to form an air receiver.
The Medicator, taken in the right hand, with the forefinger
upon the top or rubber valve, is introduced into
the proper vial, and pressing slightly upon the valve the
air is exhausted, and on removing the finger the fluid is
forced up into the tube sufficient for a dose. A little
experience will enable one to take up five, ten or more
drops as may be required. The Medicator thus charged
with the dose, can, at the convenient moment, be inserted
just within the lips of the animal’s mouth, the farther
back upon the tongue the better, when a slight pressure
upon the top of tube injects contents, and medicine is given.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Medicator</span> should be held upright; never turned
down or held horizontally; as the air is thus introduced
and the medicine may drop out. Held upright until it
is quietly inserted between the lips of the animal, no such
difficulty occurs. Nor is it necessary to push the tube far
enough into the mouth to expose it to the danger of being
broken or crushed between the teeth. The moment fluid
from tube comes upon the tongue the animal will open its
mouth, and in an instant the medicine is injected upon the
tongue or in the mouth, and the operation is finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>In other cases the tongue may be gently hooked out of
the mouth with the finger, and the medicine may be
dropped or turned upon it. Horses are fond of sugar, and
the medicine may be dropped upon a small lump, and fed
from hand. After a few times they will call for their sugar
when the owner comes into the stable, at the proper time.
With cattle or sheep, raise the head a little and inject the
medicine with the medicator, or pull the tongue out on
one side, and drop or eject the medicine upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Hogs usually, when sick, lie quietly upon the side,
and medicine may hence be injected into the mouth
with Medicator, or be given in a spoonful of sweet milk,
poured in between the jaws, or given them to drink. Care
must be taken in giving fluid to hogs, not to forcibly
raise the head, as they are easily strangled—even to death.
Dogs may have the medicine in a little sweet milk, or it
may be even turned in through the nose. Yet the
Medicator is an improvement upon all these plans, as
it takes up and discharges the proper dose at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>N. B.—Take off the rubber cap, and cleanse the Medicator
when using it for different medicines.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Housing and Care of Sick Animals</h4>

<p class='c010'>When an animal shows signs of illness, it should be
immediately cared for. The horse, unless in cases of
very slight Colic, or other ailment, when the medicine
be given at once, and his work continued, should be
placed in a roomy, convenient and warm stall, well
littered, with plenty of dry bedding, and well blanketed,
unless in very warm weather. Cattle, Sheep and Hogs,
as soon as it is noticed that they are sick, should be
separated from the herd or flock, and placed in comfortable,
well littered and especially dry apartments. This is
necessary not only to prevent disease spreading to other
stock on the farm, but for the convenience of nursing them,
giving them medicines, and also to place them in the very
best position for a cure. Often a little timely care and
nursing will save and restore an animal, which, if permitted
to run with the stock, and take its chance, would
unquestionably be lost. A sick animal as truly needs
attention as a sick child. Not always will mere nursing
restore a sick animal, but it always places it in the best
possible condition to effect a cure, and without it the best
medical treatment will often be fruitless.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diet of Sick Animals</h4>

<p class='c010'>In general, when animals are seriously ill, they are
without appetite, and will take little or no food—nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>thus indicating the propriety of abstinence. But in all
cases the food given or allowed should be quite limited in
quantity—one-half, one-third or fourth of the usual
quantity, and only that which is nourishing, easily
digested, and generally relaxing. With these general
restrictions, the usual kinds of food may be permitted,
except in the case of dogs, where <i>only stale bread and milk</i>
should be allowed in urgent cases, and but little or no
meat, and no salted or spiced food in any case. After
the more urgent symptoms of disease have passed over, and
the animal is recovering, we should be careful and not
give full feed, as a relapse may thus easily be provoked,
and prove very stubborn and dangerous.</p>

<p class='c004'>At least half an hour or an hour should intervene after
taking a dose of medicine before the animal should be fed as
the system is more susceptible then than at any other time.</p>

<p class='c004'>To evacuate the bowels—injections of water, soap and
water, or salt and water are always allowable, and may
often be used with great benefit. They are usually administered
without difficulty, in no case injurious, and should
one fail to produce an evacuation, another or more may
be repeated, until the result is accomplished.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>How to Feel the Pulse</h4>

<p class='c010'>In the horse, this is best done by placing the finger on
the artery, where it passes over the lower jaw, about four
inches below its angle. Place the forefinger on the side of
the lower jaw at its angle, and trace the jaw along gently
towards the mouth. Some four inches below the angle a
notch will be found, in which the artery passes over the
jaw, and the throbbing of the pulse will be readily felt.
Some attention may be required as the pulse beats in
health slowly, and often apparently indistinctly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pulse makes in the healthy horse from thirty-six
to forty-two beats per minute; in spirited lighter horses
the latter, and in heavy older horses the former. When
the pulse reaches fifty to fifty-five, there is some degree of
fever. Seventy-five will indicate a dangerous condition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and few horses will long survive a pulse of one hundred.
Care should be taken not to excite an animal before or
while examining the pulse, as it may thus readily be increased
ten or fifteen beats to the minute, and mislead as
to the true condition.</p>

<p class='c004'>In cattle the temple is the best place to feel the pulse
and usually runs forty-five to fifty beats per minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>In sheep and hogs the femoral artery which extends
across the inside of the thigh is most easily felt. This
should run seventy to eighty for both sheep and hogs.</p>

<p class='c004'>In dogs the pulse may be felt by placing two fingers on
the inner side of the knee. Dogs run from 90 to 100 per
minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>The heart usually beats four or five times to each breath
the animal takes (when in condition of rest). There is
also a variation in normal temperature according to the
animal as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>As this Veterinary Manual may fall into the hands of
some who are not acquainted with its use, a few practical
hints may be of service.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>1st. Follow the directions.</b>—Read and learn
what the disease or condition is.—Then give the remedy
<i>in the doses</i>, and <i>at the intervals directed</i>, as near as may be.
Don’t think you know more about the doses or <i>how much</i>
to give, or how often to give it, than the man who originated
the system and wrote the book, and whose rules and
observations are the result of very large experience.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>2d. Don’t mix the Remedies</b> with other medicines.
They won’t act if you mix them up with other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>things; or bring the patient under the influence of other
drugs, however harmless you may suppose them to be.
The sure way of safety and success, is to <i>trust</i> to the
<i>Remedies alone</i>. You will not improve the case by resorting
to other medicines or other measures. If the patient does
not improve as rapidly as you desire, a little rest will do
no harm, and the kindly reaction may come on later.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>3d. Don’t be in to great haste.</b>—Medicines
must have time to act and time to cure. In some cases,
such as colics, neuralgias or nervous pains, the evidence
of good action is prompt—almost immediately. In other
slower, less pronounced, not so decided.</p>

<p class='c004'>When you see the patient relieved.—<i>less pain</i>,—<i>more
quiet</i>,—<i>more natural</i>,—<i>easier</i>, then you know that the
remedy is <i>acting curatively</i>, and <i>don’t interfere with it</i>, by
giving new doses or other remedies or medicines. Simply
<i>let the remedy act</i>. <i>Hurrying does not hurry the cure.</i> When
a good action has begun it will continue faster when
quietly permitted to expend its action, than if doses are
multiplied upon it. The time to repeat the dose is when
the action of the former has ceased or begun to decline.
The patient is in more danger from your doing too much,
than too little, after a good action has been set up.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>4th.</b> Disease of the bones, joints and ligaments, only
get well slowly. So of old chronic affections—such as
“Spavin,” “Founder,” “Ringbone,” “Wind galls,”
“Warts,” or other blemishes. A new action has to be set
up in the implicated part, often a process of absorption
and of reformation of tissue, and <i>time</i> must be allowed for
these changes, through which only a cure can be made.
Sometimes a good reaction is only produced after some
days or even weeks use of the remedy. Such is nature’s
way of cure and you cannot hasten it. So your true
interest and true philosophy is, act <i>patiently</i>, <i>perseveringly</i>,
if you would act <i>successfully</i>.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE SKIN and SUBJACENT TISSUE</span></h3>
<h4 class='c009'>Abscess—Ulcers—Fistulas</h4>

<p class='c010'>An abscess is a collection of matter. Any tumor softening,
or in other words coming to a head, forms an abscess.
They are usually the result of injuries, such as a blow or
contusion, or may be occasioned by a thorn, nail or
splinter entering the flesh. In the more severe cases
these act in connection with a constitutional predisposition
or peculiar state of the blood.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—A hot and painful swelling; in the earlier
stage, hard, and by degrees softening or fluctuating in the
center, and gradually approaching the surface, attended
with more or less heat and fever, according to its situation
and nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>Abscesses which penetrate deeply along the sheaths of
muscles and tendons, or even to the bones are termed
<span class='fss'>FISTULAS</span>. Shallow abscesses are known as ulcers, and
these may be mild, readily healing, and secreting a
healthy, thick, cream-like pus; or ill-conditioned, unhealthy,
secreting a thin sanious discolored matter, and
healing with great difficulty. Such are the general
characteristics of all abscesses, wherever located, and
their situation and extent mark their relative importance
and danger.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—During the inflammatory stage or before
softening, while there is merely a hard, more or less hot
and painful tumor, we should endeavor to disperse it
without its softening. To this end, give three times per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>day, ten drops of A.A., and also bathe the tumor as
often with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> which
will frequently disperse it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But if the swelling increases and fluctuates, or a yellowish
spot is observed in its center, denoting the presence
of matter, it should be lanced at once, in the most depending
portion, and the matter drawn off, and fifteen drops
of the I.I., should be given morning and night to
facilitate the healing. Apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> to the
cut or open sore with end of the finger, three times per
day, to facilitate the healing.</p>

<p class='c004'>For <span class='sc'>Ulcers</span> or <span class='sc'>Sores</span>, apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, as
above.</p>

<p class='c004'>In fistulas where the canal is long and crooked, or runs
into cavities of pus, it may be laid open with the knife,
so as to heal from the bottom, or better, the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span> may be injected daily, with a small syringe, or the <span class='sc'>Oil</span>
may be inclosed in a <i>gelatine capsule</i> and gently pressed
down into the bottom of the cavity, after having pressed
out the accumulated matter. The use of the capsule
(which may be had for a trifle at the druggists, or from
this Company), is the safest and most convenient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Abscess of the Poll, Poll Evil</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is often from neglect a very formidable disease. It is
generally the result of severe injury upon the top of the
head, such as the chafing of the bridle or halter, pressure,
or a blow against the manger or stall, or frequent hanging
back against the headstall.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—At first a tumor forms at the polls or junction
of the head and neck. It soon becomes hot, tense
and painful; the horse carries his head low; looks to one
side; eats but little from the pain of chewing, especially
if the food is hard. If the tumor is not dispersed, it
comes to a head, either discharges externally, or the
matter failing to come to the surface, sinks downward,
burrowing along beneath the surface among tendons,
ligaments and bones, forming deep and obstinate fistulous
ulcers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Before the tumor has softened, give the
A.A., fifteen drops three times per day, keep the horse
on low diet, and bathe the swelling frequently with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>. This course will
usually disperse the swelling or should it fail to do so
will limit it to the smallest possible extent.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the tumor has come to a head, is soft or fluctuating,
lance it at once, evacuate the contents, and give fifteen
drops of the I.I., morning and night, apply <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Veterinary Oil</span> three times per day to the sore. For
old neglected cases apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, and give
I.I., daily.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fistula of the Withers—Sweeny</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease very much resembles Poll Evil in the textures
involved and the difficulty in curing it. It begins
with an inflammation of the connecting tissues of the
spinous processes of the dorsal vertebræ and the ultimate
formation of an abscess. Being confined by the fascia or
ligamentous structures, the matter cannot find its way to
the surface, but forms sinuses or pipes, and by the force
of gravity, burrows down among the muscles which connect
the shoulder with the trunk. Sometimes it consists
of a cyst filled with a serum, and then is easy to cure.
As the muscles of the withers are connected with all the
movements of the neck as well as the back and legs, the
disease rapidly increases, and the inflammation extends;
the shoulder becomes lower, the ligaments, cartilage,
and spinous process are involved, and extensive mischief
ensues.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—A badly fitting saddle, and most commonly a
side-saddle, which, pressing on the spinous processes of
the vertebræ, produces first soreness and subsequent
inflammation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Swelling and tenderness either on the top
of the withers or a little on one side of the spinal process
at that point; and in a short time fluctuation under the
finger. Should the skin have been much bruised, a circular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>portion sloughs out and leaves an unhealthy looking
sore, from which there is a discharge, and on further
examination with a probe we find a cyst from which there
is only one outlet, or we find fistulous ducts (“pipes,” in
farriers’ language) leading in various directions. In
many more advanced cases we only discover a hard tumor
on the withers, which will neither suppurate nor disappear
by resolution, and to which, although coming
under the head of Fistulous Withers, the term is evidently
inappropriately applied.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—First remove the cause by taking off and
quite altering the bearing of the saddle. If the swelling
is recent and does not fluctuate, thoroughly rub in the
<span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, repeating the operation every day, giving
a dose of B.B. also morning and night. If a cyst exists
and fluctuation is perceptible, it must be opened at the
most dependent portion, and the matter drawn off, and
the part rubbed with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, and a portion
of it injected into the sack or opening every day. If long
pipes or sinuses exist, they must also be opened and the
<span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> injected. Give also, morning and night,
I.I. daily.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dropsy</h4>

<p class='c010'>While dropsy is not a common disease in the horse it is
sometimes met with; particularly in horses which are fed
on the refuse from sugar factories and distilleries.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may be caused from improper feeding, or may be
only a symptom of some other disease, particularly diseases
of the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dropsy is a morbid accumulation of watery fluid confined
to certain parts of the body. The disease is divided
into varieties corresponding to the respective localization
of the accumulated water, as for instance, anasarca
(water in the skin); ascites (water in the abdomen);
hydrothorax (water in the chest).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In the first form (anasarca) it is first
noticed on the lower parts of the body, as the legs, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>surface of the chest, etc. The skin is swollen and doughy
to the touch and retains the impression of the fingers;
but is neither painful nor of abnormally high temperature.</p>

<p class='c004'>In ascites there is a gradual enlargement of the abdomen
and when pressed upon, the fluid can be felt to flow from
side to side and the part with the water gives a dull sound
on being struck. Breathing is quicker and impeded and
the appetite diminished, but there is no fever.</p>

<p class='c004'>In hydrothorax the symptoms are much the same
except that it takes place in the region of the chest
instead of the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—It will generally be relieved by giving the
H.H., in doses of fifteen drops three times per day for
trifling cases, or ten drops every three hours for the more
severe ones. After a free discharge of urine is established,
giving the medicine three times per day will be sufficient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Eczema</h4>

<p class='c010'>(See also Mange page <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>)</p>

<p class='c004'>In the horse, eczema represents practically all forms of
skin disease except the parasitic and is seen in the following
forms and regions.</p>

<p class='c004'>1—A form seen in hot weather and variously known as
herpes, lichen, summer or saddle mange, and heat pimples.
This occurs under the harness where sweating is most
profuse, at first as scabby pimples, after which the hair
sticks together and falls, leaving scaly bare patches.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—Then there is a form of scaly eczema which attacks
the head, neck, shoulders, elbows, etc. This is a chronic
form, with the production of branny scales with thickening
of the skin accompanied by itching.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—A pustular form which attacks chiefly the skin under
the mane and tail. The skin is raw and weeping, while
the hair mats together in masses and falls and there is
a tendency to the chronic scaly form.</p>

<p class='c004'>4—Eczema attacking the legs is known as mallenders
and sallenders if on the back of the knee, or the front of
the hock, while if above the heels, in the bend of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>pastern it is known as grease. This is characterized by
heat, swelling and redness, followed by a vesiculated
weeping surface with the formation of a greasy, offensive
discharge, scabs and cracks in the skin, followed by loss
of hair. Sometimes the irritant secretion gives rise to
production of fungus wart-like granulations, known as
“grapes” accompanied by great thickening of the skin
and swelling of the limbs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eczema probably comes from both external and internal
causes. Among the external causes are improper grooming
and cleansing of the skin, exposure of the animal to
constant rain and the use of irritant soap. Grease may
be caused by clipping the hair about the fetlock in cold
weather and cleaning before the hair has entirely dried.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the internal causes are hereditary disposition,
improper diet and use of drugs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—First clean the sores, removing all dirt,
scabs, etc. For this purpose olive oil is better than water
as soap and water are apt to cause further irritation. (If
about the tail or mane, clip the hair around the sores).
Apply Zinc Ointment at night and morning. Give A.A.
three time per day for two days, then I.I. instead of the
A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>When in the form of “Grease” on the fetlocks, remove
the hair from the sores and cleanse them well. In bad
cases the application of a bran poultice cleanses them
beautifully. Keep the legs as dry as possible. Feed with
relaxing or green food, bran mashes, and less stimulating
food, especially in the early stage, and give fifteen drops
of A.A. Keep the legs as free from dirt as possible. If
the horse is not worked let him have exercise daily, and
each night and morning after the leg is cleaned apply
Zinc Ointment.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hidebound</h4>

<p class='c010'>This condition is not a disease of itself, but a mere
symptom of some other disease, most frequently of the
stomach; such as a disordered stomach; poor food, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>long exposure to rough, stormy weather. It not unfrequently
exists in connection with Glanders, Grease,
Founder or old disease of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—It manifests itself by the hair looking rough
and unthrifty, without its natural smoothness and gloss;
and the skin feels hard, firm and fixed to the flesh.</p>

<p class='c004'>We can most successfully treat it by ascertaining and
removing the cause upon which it depends. But in the
absence of any special indication, we may give with the
best success a dose of fifteen drops of J.K., each morning,
and the same of I.I., each night. A few days treatment
will generally produce a most marked improvement.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Mange</h4>

<p class='c010'>(See also Eczema page <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>)</p>

<p class='c004'>Mange is a disease of the skin which has much the
same appearance as eczema but is caused by parasites
while eczema is not.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are three forms of mange in the horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>1—Sarcoptic mange caused by a burrowing mite which
feeds and propagates in the lower layers of the skin.
This form is usually found on the head, neck, shoulders
and outer parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—Dermatodecic mange caused by sucking mites which
live on the outer layers of the skin and suck up serum and
lymph. This form is usually found on the inside of the
thighs, root of the mane and tail, sheat, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—Symbiotic mange caused by scale eating mites which
live and feed on the surface of the skin. This form is
usually found on the feet and pasterns.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last two varieties of mites can be seen by the naked
eye but better by a magnifying glass. The first variety
can be seen only by a glass and that with difficulty due to
their burrowing under the skin.</p>

<p class='c004'>One should be careful to distinguish mange from eczema
as the origin and treatment of the two diseases are quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>different, although the eruption looks much the same in
each case.</p>

<p class='c004'>1—Eczema is much more common in the horse than
mange.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—In mange there is a more definite boundary to the
patches than in eczema.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—In mange the itching is much more intense.</p>

<p class='c004'>4—The actual discovery of the parasites by the aid of
the magnifying glass is of course the final test.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Consists of clipping the hair around the
infected patches, then cleaning them with oil or glycerine
containing five per cent of creolin or lysol. Then apply
a thick lather of green soap and leave on for twenty-four
hours. This is to soften the scabs and prepare the skin
for the actual remedy. For this purpose sulphur ointment
(equal parts of sulphur and lard) is an old standby or a
three per cent solution of creolin or lysol is good. The
remedy must be thoroughly rubbed with a brush into the
infected parts and when rubbed off by the animal reapplied
for a period of a week. Then wash off and repeat the
treatment two or three times.</p>

<p class='c004'>In addition to this the horse should be removed from
the other animals and all stalls, blankets, etc., that he
has used should be cleaned by boiling water and a five per
cent solution of creolin and lysol. This is necessary in
order to destroy the mites which remain on such articles
and which might infect the other animals or reinfect the
horse.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Swelled Legs</h4>

<p class='c010'>This affection is of frequent occurrence in horses, and is
more especially observed in coarse and badly groomed
animals. The hind legs are most subject to it, although
it frequently extends to the fore legs. Sometimes from
metastasis of disease from other parts, the legs swell to an
enormous degree, and it is attended with some degree of
heat, tenderness, and peculiar lameness. The pulse is
quickened, and there is evident fever. In such cases there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>is some inflammation of the cellular tissue, and an effusion
of fluid forming the swelling. In these cases when there
is heat and tenderness, a few doses of fifteen drops each
of A. A., for <span class='sc'>Fever</span>, will soon relieve the lameness and
swelling. If the legs are swelled without being lame or
painful, the I.I., should be given morning and night,
with careful grooming and exercise, this will soon
reduce the swelling. If the swelling is accompanied with
<span class='sc'>Scanty Urination</span>, the H.H., given three times per
day is the proper remedy for the difficulty. Sometimes
swelled legs are merely the result of a change of feed, and
hence often occur in spring and fall, or when horses are
taken from pasture and confined in close stables. Consult
also <span class='sc'>Grease</span> or <span class='sc'>Scratches</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Swelling of the Teats</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes from cold or injury, the teats in mares are
subject to inflammatory swelling. A few doses, ten drops
each, of A. A., for <span class='sc'>Fever</span>, will relieve, and if the parts seem
quite tender, bathe them with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel
Witch Hazel</span> or apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ringworm</h4>

<p class='c010'>Ringworm is a disease caused by a vegetable parasite,
or fungus, which lives on hair follicles and the hair itself.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—It makes its appearance most frequently on
the seat of the saddle, on the croup or flanks and sometimes
on the head. The spots range in size from a dime
to a half dollar and usually form a fairly regular circle.
The hair has fallen out or is broken off and there is a
scaling of the skin inside the circle. The surrounding
hair can easily be pulled out. Itching is generally absent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Same as for mange. (See Mange page <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Lice</h4>

<p class='c010'>Horses taken up from a straw yard, with long, shaggy
coats, in poor condition, are sometimes found infested
with lice.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—Contagion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The animal is seen continually biting his
sides and quarters, rubs himself against walls and posts,
or anything within his reach, denuding the skin of hair
in patches and making it bleed. On close examination
we have no difficulty in discovering the lice in bare patches.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The horse should be removed from the
other animals. The stalls, blankets, etc., that he has
used should be thoroughly cleaned by boiling water and
a five per cent solution of creolin or lysol, to destroy the
lice which will cling to stalls, blankets, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>The horse should be washed with green soap and water
and kerosene (Coal Oil) should be applied night and
morning for two days and then removed by soap and
water. This must be done three times at intervals of a
week, in order to kill the new generations of lice which
hatch from the eggs in about six days.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tubercles</h4>

<p class='c010'>These small, sluggish swellings are caused by friction,
contusion, cold, stings of insects, internal disease, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If they are the result of external violence,
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> or <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>,
applied externally, is beneficial. The I. I., may be given
with advantage morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Sponge</h4>

<p class='c010'>This term is given to a round, spongy excresence on
the knee, generally caused by some external injury. It
is at first a hot, painful swelling; then becomes a cold,
hard, indolent tumor. It sometimes occasions considerable
itching and emits purulent matter.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If sponge arises from some injury, the
<span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> should be well rubbed in, two or three
times a day; or applied morning and night; at the same
time, also administer I. I., morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Sweating</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes on very moderate exercise, horses sweat to
excess. It is often the result of weakness, poor food or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>some internal condition. Give J.K., a few times, in
doses of fifteen drops, morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tumors, Swellings</h4>

<p class='c010'>Any unusual or morbid growth or enlargement may be
termed a tumor, and when one is found upon any part of
an animal, care should be taken to ascertain, if possible,
its nature and cause. They are variously named, according
to their locality and the nature of their contents.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes they are globular or conical, or again flattened,
or again pedunculated (having a neck). Some are
quite firm and hard, others spongy, and others contain
fluid.</p>

<p class='c004'>Encysted Tumors (so called because the enlargement is
closed in a sack) are frequent, more or less round, movable
beneath the skin, painless, and sometimes attain to
a considerable size. They are the result of some internal
cause not easily defined.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In all cases where a tumor or swelling is
hot or painful, give A.A., every two, four or six
hours, in doses of fifteen drops, according to the
urgency of the case. Keep the animals on low diet and
thus seek to disperse it. If caused by external pressure
or injury, annoint the part frequently with <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span>. If the tumor, notwithstanding the treatment, has
softened, grows whitish at some point, painful and smaller,
open it, then treat it as an ulcer, giving I.I., morning
and night.</p>

<p class='c004'>In case of <i>cold tumors</i> or hot tumors, after the heat has
been reduced, simply give I.I., at night, or noon and
night, and the J.K., in the morning, in doses of fifteen
drops, until the tumor is dispersed or the condition
favoring the production is destroyed. Encysted and
fatty tumors will generally have to be taken out by the
knife and the opening annointed with <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>
and again neatly brought together to prevent a scar.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Warts</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Warts are so well known as to require no description.
Certain horses and young animals are most subject to
them. They vary in size and appearance, are smooth or
shaggy, pedunculated or have a large base and some are
soft, moist or spongy. They sometimes arise after chafing
or an injury, but depend essentially upon an internal
cause.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give I.I. in doses of fifteen drops, every
two or three days for a few weeks, this should cause
their entire disappearance. Apply also daily the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span>, scraping off the rough outside of the wart
with the thumb nail before or while applying the <span class='sc'>Oil</span>.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.—<span class='sc'>Part I</span>.<br> <span class='c007'>MECHANICAL INJURIES AND WOUNDS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of injuries and wounds is a branch of
Veterinary Surgery of the utmost importance to the
owners of horses, for accidents are of every day occurrence.
We shall, however, not be able to devote so much
space to the subject as some would deem desirable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Flesh Wounds may be classified as <i>Contused Wounds</i>,
when there is an injury inflicted on the surface of the
body by mechanical violence without rending the skin;
<i>Incised Wounds</i>, when such an injury is inflicted by a
clean cutting instrument; <i>Lacerated</i> or <i>Jagged Wounds</i>,
when the parts are torn and the lips of the wound are
irregular; and <i>Punctured Wounds</i>, when the injury is deep
rather than broad, and the effect of piercing as by a stab.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Contused Wounds</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Wounds are said to be “contused” when
the skin, although bruised, is not cut through or broken;
they are followed by the usual symptoms of inflammation,
namely, redness, swelling, heat and pain.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—These can be best understood by one or two
illustrative examples. A horse gets the collar chain
around his heels at night when he becomes fast, and, in
struggling to free himself, he bruises and excoriates the
hollow of the pastern. Next morning he is found very
lame, with swelling and great tenderness of the parts,
but there is no rent in the skin. He has what is called
“Contused Wound.” Or, another cause of injury commonly
occurs in cavalry stables, where the horses are
separated from each other by an iron bar, over which
one of them manages to get one of his hind legs. In
struggling to get back, he bruises the inside of his thighs,
and probably his belly as well. Next day we find him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>with his leg considerably swollen, lame, and tender on
pressure, from “Contused Wounds.” Other causes are
kicks from horses, blows from bad-tempered grooms, and
falling on hard ground.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> to the part
two or three times per day, and give the first day or two,
the A.A., three times per day, after which, an occasional
dose of I.I.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Incised Wounds</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Incised wounds are those in which a clean
cut is made through the integuments or parts underneath,
merely dividing textures without lacerating them, and
are generally caused by some sharp instrument.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In such cases it is necessary to bring the
lips of the wound together, and retain them so by what
are called sutures, the best of which is an ordinary pin
passed through the skin a quarter of an inch from the
edges of the wound, whose lips are then kept close
together by the further addition of a small piece of tow
passed over, under and around the pin, forming a
figure thus $, after which the point of the pin may
be cut off with a pair of scissors. These pins, or, as
they are called, “twisted sutures,” may be placed one
inch apart from each other. Most Veterinary Surgeons
use what is called the “interrupted suture,” as
follows: A curved needle, armed with a strong thread,
well waxed, is passed through the skin on each side
of the wound, when the ends of the thread are drawn
together and tied in a common knot. As many of these
stitches are to be made as the length of the wound renders
necessary, but they should be about three-quarters of an
inch apart. These sutures, as a general rule, should be
allowed to remain as long as they will; but should an
effusion of serum or matter take place in the interior of
the wound, the lower or most dependent one should be
taken out, and the fluid allowed to escape; and then,
but not before, warm applications may be applied.
Exceptional cases, however, do occur when, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>extent of the injury, considerable swelling takes place
about the third day, and constitutional disturbance intervenes.
In these cases the sutures may be removed; but
in the majority, the swelling must be looked upon as a
natural consequence attendant on the formation of lymph,
which may be seen oozing from the lips of the wound,
and which is necessary to glue them together, till the
small vessels pass from side to side and form a permanent
bond of union. Always dress the wound and keep
the edges of the opening moist with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span>, applying it from day to day, to prevent inflammation,
suppuration and to promote healing by “first intention.”
The interrupted or thread suture is preferable for wounds
about the head, as the horse would probably tear out the
pin by rubbing it against the rack or manger. Previous
to applying sutures, we should remove all foreign bodies
and clots of blood from the wound, and oil every part
well with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, and give A.A. four times
a day.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Hemorrhage</i>, although causing great alarm to the uninitiated
in veterinary science, is generally a matter of
very little consequence, except a large artery is divided,
as the bleeding will soon stop without our assistance.
But should the blood come in jets, be of a bright scarlet
color, and not stop in a reasonable time, we should either
seize the open mouth of the vessel with forceps and pass
a ligature around it or apply a compress of tow and a
bandage. Cold water dashed on the part, or <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Marvel Witch Hazel</span> will frequently have the desired
effect.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Lacerated or Jagged Wounds</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—By these are meant that description of
injury to the soft parts where the skin and subtextures,
instead of being simply divided, are torn asunder and
present a jagged and irregular appearance, and are often
much bruised.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—They are caused by mechanical injuries, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>as hooks and nails in stables, or by carriage poles or
shafts running into a horse.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Our first object is to remove all foreign
bodies from the wound, and to cut off all lacerated
portions, whether of skin, muscle or tendon, which cannot
be retained in their original position. Then all grit
or sand must be washed away by dashing cold water on
the wound, should there be much hemorrhage; or bathing
it with warm water, should the bleeding be inconsiderable.
Having thus produced a tolerably even and
clean wound, and removed those parts which we know
would be removed by sloughing, we assist nature by sewing
up such portions of skin and muscle as are not too
much injured to preclude the hope of their growing in
their original position, although we may abandon all
hopes of the wound uniting by the first intention. This
we accomplish by thread sutures, as in the case of incised
wounds, but with this difference, that we do not bring
the lips of the wound together, but at once have recourse
to hot applications and bandages wherever they can be
applied. The use of the latter is to preserve the lacerated
parts in their original position, to exclude air, and to
prevent the water washing away the lymph, which is
necessary for the filling up of the wound; consequently
the bandage should not be removed for a few days,
except that the swelling renders it actually necessary to
do so. The warm application reduces the tension in the
part, favors circulation and the exudation of lymph, and
by its soothing effects prevents that constitutional disturbance
which is so much to be dreaded in this class of
wounds. In about a week the inflammation will have
partially subsided and suppuration will most probably
have taken place, when we remove the bandage and discontinue
the hot application, merely letting a little water
run over the wound to remove superfluous matter. It
is undesirable to use a sponge, because it would remove
the lymph at the same time and expose the small vessels
to the atmosphere, which are busily engaged in repairing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the injury, which, acting on them as an irritant, causes
them to secrete exuberant and unhealthy granulations
called “proud flesh.” For the same reason, unless the
matter is very plentiful and has a bad smell, it is better
not to apply even water, or in any way remove the lymph.</p>

<p class='c004'>The best possible dressing for all such injuries is
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>, which should be applied
to all the raw or cut surface before being sewed or bound
up, and then kept applied to the raw surface, both to
prevent inflammation and to promote healing, and to
hasten the process of cicatrisation, or the skinning over
of the wound. Apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> twice per day.
Should the granulations rise above the surrounding skin,
or “proud flesh” appear, <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> is still the
best application, and will soon reduce the unhealthy
growth and induce a natural healing.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Punctured Wounds</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—These have small openings externally,
but are usually deeper and of a much more serious
nature than others. Because from their depth they are
liable to implicate blood-vessels, nerves, viscera, and
other deep-seated parts of importance. And because the
parts which they traverse are stretched and torn, and
consequently disposed to inflame and suppurate. And
because matter, when formed, has no free exit, and is
liable to burrow extensively. Finally, because foreign
bodies may be carried into great depths without being
suspected, and create long continued irritation, and
because they are most liable to be followed by Tetanus.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—These wounds are caused by any sharp pointed
instrument, such as a pitch-fork, nail or scissors, or by
stabs or thorns, bayonet or sabre thrusts.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Our first object is to remove all foreign
bodies, such as splinters, thorns, or balls, should it be a
gun shot wound. Should the puncture not be in the
neighborhood of a joint, or penetrating a tendon or bursal
cavity, it is then generally advisable to enlarge the orifice
of the wound by passing a sharp knife to the bottom of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and convert the punctured into an incised wound, when
it must be treated by injecting <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> in all
cases where it is possible to do so, and in all cases by
keeping the <span class='sc'>Oil</span> applied to the open wound or sore until
it is entirely healed. Give also A.A. morning, noon and
night; after which give I.I. morning and evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>When a tendon is punctured and the thecal fluid escapes,
the nature of the injury in no way differs from an open
joint in the mode of treatment to be pursued, which will
be found fully explained in the Section on open joint,
page <a href='#Page_44'>44</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Laceration of the Tongue</h4>

<p class='c010'>This wound may be caused by a high port bit, by the
forcible and careless administration of balls and drinks;
by the end of a halter being passed over the tongue to
guide the horse instead of a bit; by a fall when the
tongue is between the incisors; by rough, long or irregular
teeth; by thorns, sharp bones, needles, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Slavering from the mouth and inability to
feed will lead to an investigation of the mouth, when the
laceration can be plainly seen.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Foreign bodies should be removed. The
horse should be fed on green food, if it can be procured,
and no bit put in the mouth for some days. The best
application is the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> applied daily. If
ulcers form, I.I. should be administered also.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Saddle Galls—Warbles—Sitfast—Serous Cyst</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—When a saddle or collar has galled the
skin of the back and shoulders, effusion takes place into
the tissue underneath. If a small circumscribed tumor is
the result, we call it a “Warble”; or, if a large flat
swelling with abrasion of the skin be found, the name of
“Saddle Gall” or “Harness Gall” is given to it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—These disorders often arise from a ill-fitting
saddle or collar, also by removing the saddle too soon.
After a march soldiers are not allowed to strip their
horses until they cool under the saddle.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> morning and
night, and give I.I. as often, until the healing begins;
then give J.K. morning and noon, and I.I. at night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Staking</h4>

<p class='c010'>In leaping fences or gates, the belly of the horse is
sometimes impaled and wounded. The extent of the
injury is not always apparent outwardly, and can only be
ascertained by careful examination with the finger.
There may be no wound in the skin, but the muscle
underneath may be injured and torn, and the bowel may
enter the part torn; or the stake may pierce the abdomen
and a portion of the bowel may protrude outwardly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In the former case, a well fitting pad
must be made and bandaged on; the bandages or pad
being well oiled with <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the latter case, the horse must be kept quite still,
and treated where he is. The protruding bowel must be
gently and carefully washed from all blood, dust and grit
with warm water, then oiled and replaced by very gentle
pressure. The lips of the wound must then be oiled and
drawn together and kept in place with pins. A pad
saturated with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> should then be placed
on the wound and kept in place by a bandage around the
body. If the bowel itself is wounded, it must be stitched
with catgut ligatures, and then replaced. If this is impracticable
at the time, a pad and bandage should be
placed on injured part until surgical aid can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c004'>As there is danger of inflammation, A.A. should be
given at two-hour intervals, and also a dose of I.I. each
day. The horse should be kept very quiet and fed
sparingly on soft food.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Capped Elbow</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a swelling formed at the point of the elbow,
consisting of an infiltration of bloody serum, and thickened
skin. It may be the result of a blow, but is most
generally caused by the horse in so lying that the calks
of the shoe press upon the elbow joint. In some cases,
inflammatory action sets in, and the tumor softens and
is discharged, or if the pressure is continued, the swelling
becomes hard and firm.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—When the injury is recent, apply hot
water three times per day, and afterwards apply the
Veterinary Oil. Alter the shoe by removing the
calks and smoothing the shoe, as far as possible, to
prevent any further irritation. Should it have become
soft and matter formed it should be treated as an abscess.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Capped Hock</h4>

<p class='c010'>This form of injury most frequently results from kicking
or some similar violence, and manifests itself either
as a swelling at the point of the hock, which consists of
an effusion of bloody serum and thickened skin; or the
swelling bulges out on each side of the hock, making the
enlargement more prominent at the sides. This is found
to consist of an enlargement of the bursa or small bags,
which contain the lubricating fluid for the part, and over
which the sinews glide.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give ten drops of B.B., three times per
day. Wash the part with hot water morning and
night, applying the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> afterwards as for
capped elbow. After the heat and irritation are
reduced, careful hand-rubbing and the use of I.I., at
night will do much to disperse the enlargement of the
bursa.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Curb</h4>

<p class='c010'>At the back of the hock, three or four inches below its
point, an enlargement or swelling arises which has received
the name of <i>curb</i>. It is a strain of the ring-like ligament
which binds the tendons in their place, or of the sheath
itself. It comes on in consequence of a violent strain of
the flexor tendons, or from a blow, kick, or contusion
upon the part. It is most likely to occur in cow-hocked
horses, where the hocks are turned inward, and the legs
form a considerable angle outward, as in such cases the
angular ligament must be continually on the stretch in
order to confine the tendon.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it first occurs, the swelling may not be great but
is attended with warmth, pain and lameness, the leg being
moved with caution and awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In recent cases, frequent bathing of the
part with the <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> diluted
one-half water, allowing the horse to rest, and give A.A.
at first, then B.B., three times per day. The application
of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>, morning and night will
be better after the heat and swelling have mostly subsided.
Rest is absolutely essential. If prematurely put to hard
labor it is very likely to return again. If the curb is
permitted to run its course, the acute stage will pass off
leaving a hard, cold tumor, which may materially interfere
with the motion of the joint. All old cases require
B.B., once or twice daily, for some weeks.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Docking</h4>

<p class='c010'>By docking the tail of a horse, his shape and external
appearance are sometimes improved, yet the operation is
not without its consequences, such as inflammation, nervous
irritation, fistulous ulcers, tetanous, etc. It is hoped
that the time is not distant when this barbarous and
senseless custom will be abolished, and the stern hand of
the law laid upon every man who thus mutilates
God’s creatures. Yet if the senseless operation is done,
dress the wound with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>,
which keep applied to the wound. Give first fifteen
drops of A.A., and after a few hours, the same of B.B.,
which may be repeated from time to time to relieve the
soreness and inflammation.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fractures</h4>

<p class='c010'>Fractures of the bones of the horse occasionally occur
in consequence of some severe blow, contusion, fall, or
other injury. They are discoverable from the <i>difference
in shape</i>, <i>swelling</i>, <i>lameness of the part</i>, and especially by
the “<span class='fss'>CREPITUS</span>,” or grating sound, which occurs from
moving the two fractured ends of bone together. In all
doubtful cases, this crepitation is the reliable criterion.
In the more palpable cases, the distortion, loss of the use
of the part, and extensive swelling, remove all doubt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the most common are fractures of the ribs,
forming a swelling over the place, which is very sensitive to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>pressure. Of the pelvis, rendering one hip lower than the
other. Of the leg, rendering movement and use of the
limb impossible, the point below the fracture swinging
about useless.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fractures are <i>simple</i> where a single break occurs in one
bone, <i>compound</i> when the surrounding parts are lacerated,
and <i>comminuted</i> when bones are broken up or fractured
in different directions.</p>

<p class='c004'>The treatment of all fractures rest upon very simple
principles. Bring the broken parts to their natural
position, keeping them there until they unite, the more
perfectly this is done, the more perfect will be the result.
Unfortunately, from the weight of the animal, and often
his intractability, this is not always easy or even possible.
But, on the other hand, nature will eventually heal even
the worst cases, requiring, it is true, a longer time, and
leaving behind very sad traces of her faulty workmanship.
So that in treating a fracture, all these elements should
be taken into consideration.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fracture of the ribs</i>: Bathe the swelling with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, and the parts will soon unite.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fracture of the haunch bone</i> cannot be reduced, but
nature will ere long heal it, though with some distortion,
one hip will be lower than the other.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fractures of the leg</i>, from the weight of the animal, are
extremely difficult to manage. It can only be done by
suspending the animal by stout canvas passing under the
belly and attached to rollers on either side and by means
of pulleys raising him up so that the feet just touch the
ground, the canvas being supplied with heavy bands,
before and behind, to keep the body securely fixed in the
canvas. The fractured ends of the limb should then be
carefully adjusted and the limb wound well with a roller-bandage,
then a pair of iron splints, grooved so as to fit the
limb, and well wadded with tow; the splint that is behind
two or three inches longer than the foot, should be securely
bound on. The whole internal bandage should be bathed
with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> and kept wet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>with it, from time to time, for a week. This will subdue
inflammation and hasten the union of the parts. After
eight days, the splints should be removed and the limb
examined, and again replaced, to remain five or six weeks,
at the end of which time the splint may be removed and
a simple bandage and lighter splint retained until the
cure is perfected in some six weeks longer, when the
animal may be trusted to use his limb. If the ends are in
proper apposition and maintained there, the union will
be perfect, with but little swelling or deformity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general treatment of all fractures is to place the
parts in apposition, keep them there by proper splints
and bandage, and keep the place wet with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Marvel Witch Hazel</span> until the heat and swelling have
subsided. Give also a dose of A.A., every two hours, for
the first three days, to reduce the heat and fever; then
alternate the B.B. with A.A. a dose every three or four
hours during the day, to promote reunion.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Sprains or Strains and Dislocations</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sprains of various joints or parts occur which are more or
less grave or serious, depending upon the extent of injury
or the joint involved. If a bone is displaced it is termed a
dislocation. The joint becomes painful, swelling soon
ensues, and on comparing the joint with its fellow, we
perceive the distortion; the limb is longer or shorter, and
the animal moves it with great difficulty or not at all. If
the bone is not moved from its position, but the ligaments
are merely injured, or torn, or joints otherwise
bruised, it is termed a sprain. The swelling in this case
is often as severe and even more so than in case of actual
dislocation. Yet the accident is not so serious, because
in cases of horses and cattle, a dislocation is not always
curable, and if the joint be replaced the danger of new
dislocation is far more imminent than though it had
never occurred.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Sprains and dislocations occur from false
steps, slipping, leaping across ditches, sudden springing,
violent effort in drawing a load, or sudden turning, or
from falls, blows, kicks, contusions, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In all such cases the indications are
simple, yet the execution of them is sometimes very
difficult. For sprains, bathe the parts with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, to keep down the swelling and
inflammation, renewing the application from time to
time at intervals of two, four, or six hours, according to
the urgency of the case, and give six doses of A.A.
three hours apart, then B.B. morning, noon and night.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Sprains of the Fet-Lock.</b>—A sprain of this joint sometimes
occurs, manifested by heat, swelling, and lameness
more or less decided, and especially manifested when the
horse is moving on uneven ground. When recent, bathe
the part with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, and
saturate a bandage with it, wrap it up, moistening it from
time to time, and giving B.B., two or three times per
day, fifteen drops at a dose. The pain and lameness will
gradually abate.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Luxation of the Patella, or Stifle.</b>—Under the influence
of a severe blow, a sudden leap or strain, the
patella, or knee-pan is sometimes displaced. The animal
holds his leg stiff and extended, cannot rest on it, and
when obliged to walk, draws it along. This displacement
of the patella is called being <span class='fss'>STIFLED</span>. The displacement
can be reduced by the aid of sufficient help, and placing
a side-line with a hopple on the pastern of the affected
limb, and drawing the hind leg forward, the surgeon will
then, with both hands, bring the bone to its place.</p>

<p class='c004'>Often the reduction is effected of itself if the horse
makes the slightest effort. The part should be bathed in
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, as the ligaments are
always injured; give fifteen drops of B.B. three times a day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Injuries of the stifle, bruises, strains, etc., often occur,
and should be treated by bathing the part with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, and giving the
animal the above Remedy for injuries.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sprain of the Psoas Muscles.—This occurs from
drawing heavy loads on soft ground, or from horses’ hind
legs slipping back on ice, or from jumping a bank.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Difficulty in bringing up the hind legs
when made to move, and sometimes inability to stand.
It may be mistaken for spinal injury, but the difference
is as follows: When the spine is injured, complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>paralysis takes place, whereas in Sprain of the Psoas
Muscles the animal is able to kick and to extend the leg
with great force. Examination <i>per rectum</i> will leave no
doubt as to the nature of the injury, for pain on pressure,
and swelling of the muscles, will be evident.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give B.B., morning and night.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Sprains of the Muscles of the Haunch.</b>—The gluteal
muscles are sometimes sprained by violent exertion. The
injury will be followed by effusion, swelling, and stiffness
of the quarters, and afterwards by a gradual wasting of
the muscles, which can be perceived by standing behind
the animal and comparing the quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Warm applications, A.A., and, after the
inflammation has somewhat subsided, the B.B. four
times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Hip Joint Lameness.</b>—This lameness may be produced
by a sprain of the round ligaments, or gluteus externus
muscle; but it more frequently arises from a sprain of
the tendon of the gluteus maximus at its insertion into
the trochanter major.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—A dragging and rotary motion of the leg,
pain on pressure, and a swelling which fills up the
natural furrow, so well defined in well bred horses,
formed by the semi-membranous and gluteus externus.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This is the same as for Sprain of the
Muscles of the Haunch.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Sprain of the Stifle Joint.</b>—This is not very common,
but when it does occur it may be easily recognized by the
swelling, which, being superficial, can be easily felt, and
by the pain caused by pressure. The action is also
peculiar, the animal is unwilling to advance the hind leg,
and drags it after him in trotting.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Warm applications frequently applied,
and <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> morning and
evening. As soon as the inflammation subsides the
warm application must be discontinued, and a dose of
B.B. given three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Sprain of the Hock.</b>—The tendons and ligaments of
this joint are all liable to be sprained in leaping and
galloping through heavy ground. The tendons of the
gastrocnemii internus, or those which retain the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>in its place, sometimes become lacerated, and allow the
cap formed by the gastrocnemii tendon to slip off the os
calcis to the outside. In such an accident we cannot
replace the tendon, but with rest and warm applications
the animal may become fit for road-work.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tendon of the flexor pedis perforans, which passes
down the back of the hock, is occasionally sprained, and
the sprain is followed by a thickening, and sometimes
ossification of the tendon. The extensor pedis at the
front of the hock may also be sprained, and this occurs
just where the tendon passes under the inferior annular
ligaments, and, being accompanied by distension of the
bursa, may be mistaken for sprain.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ligaments connecting the bones of the hock may
suffer from an ordinary sprain, which, if discovered and
properly treated, may be easily cured. But, unfortunately,
the sprain is seldom discovered until the
inflammation has wrought an important pathological
change in the tarsal ligaments, whereby their structure
loses its elasticity and becomes converted into a cartilaginous
or bony substance. If this takes place in the
inner part of the hock, we call the disease Spavin;
but if on the posterior part we call it Curb. These
are usually classed as diseases of the bone, but they
more properly belong to this category, as they are an
effect of long continued and neglected Sprain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give fifteen drops of B.B., three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cutting, Brushing, Speedy-Cut,</h4>
<p class='c010'>Over-Reach and Tread.</p>

<p class='c004'>These are names given to bruises caused by one foot
striking against another foot or leg.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Cutting or Brushing</b> is caused by a foot striking the
opposite fetlock or cannon bone. It may occur before or
behind; usually behind. It arises from defective structure
of the legs, or from wasting of the legs in horses badly fed,
so that they are brought abnormally near to each other.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Speedy-Cut.</b>—The inside of one or both feet usually
strikes the fetlock joint of the opposite foot in passing it;
but sometimes the cannon bone is struck just below the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>knee; the bruise thus caused is called “Speedy-cut.” It
occurs during fast action, generally in horses with badly
shaped legs. It is more dangerous than common cutting,
because the pain is more severe and the shock to the
system greater, so much so that sometimes the horse falls
as if he were shot. Examination may discover a small
bare place, partially concealed by adjacent hair, or a
contusion, or an abrasion of the skin, or a scab on the
inside of the cannon bone. In bad cases the periosteum
may be swollen and the bone itself enlarged.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This should be the same as for common
cutting; but in all probability the only effectual remedy
will be the construction of a speedy-cut boot, with a pad
on the inside of the leg reaching from the knee to the
fetlock, kept in position by buckles, and resting on the
fetlock joint.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Treads and Over-Reaches.</b>—These are names given to
a wound between hair and hoof, inflicted either on the
fore coronary substance by the shoe of the hind foot, or
on the hind leg by another horse treading on it. Cart
horses may inflict the injury on themselves with the calk
of the shoe. These wounds are sometimes difficult to
heal in consequence of the difference in organization of
the parts injured, the exterior being highly vascular, but
the interior cartilaginous.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Every portion of detached <i>horn</i>, <i>hair</i> or
<i>skin</i> must be removed and the wound cleansed and
dressed with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> placed on soft tow and
bound up with broad tape. On the third and every subsequent
day the dressing may be removed, but warm
applications and poultices must be avoided. In cases of
neglect or ill-treatment the suppurative process may
have become established, and the warm applications may
be necessary. If neglected the disease may end in Quittor.</p>

<p class='c004'>In all cases of <span class='sc'>Injuries</span> or <span class='sc'>Bruises</span>, give A.A., and B.B.
in alternation, two doses of each per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Broken Knee</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a very vague term and may imply simply to a
bruise, an abrasion of the skin, or a division of the
tendons or of the capsule of the joints.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Mechanical, such as falling or striking the
knee against some hard and sharp substance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—There may be a simple bruise, without
perforation of the skin, which, though not strictly speaking
a broken knee, may be conveniently regarded as such;
the knee is hot, swollen and painful, and sometimes hair
is removed, or there may be abrasion of the skin, or it
may be cut through, torn and jagged, and the underlying
tissues more or less injured, the sheath of the
tendon being exposed. If no glairy fluid issue at the
time the joint is not open, and there is no cause for
uneasiness about anything except the blemish which may
remain, but which will generally be very slight if suitable
treatment be adopted. A more serious form of Broken
Knee is where it is bruised, cut or lacerated, and opened
down to the joint, accompanied by the escape of clear
synovial fluid, “joint oil,” like the white of an egg;</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The horse’s head must be racked up for a
few days or placed in cradles, to prevent his biting the
wound. In broken knees where the skin and subtextures
are very much contused, and where such a quantity of
sand has become imbedded that suppuration is a necessary
consequence, it is well to put on a turnip or carrot poultice
(but never bran, for it acts as an irritant). A leg of a
woolen stocking should be drawn up over the knee and
fastened around the leg at the lower part with a piece of
tape, then, from above, the space in front of the knee can
be filled with mashed turnip; the upper part of the stocking
can then be fastened as the lower. The poultice may
be repeated morning and evening for about three days,
when suppuration will most probably be established, and
no further treatment be necessary unless the granulations
become too luxuriant, when the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> may be
applied, but not too freely or too often. In a few days
the scab will fall off, and if cicatrisation has not taken
place, the process may be hastened by washing the part
three times a day with tepid water, or better, with the
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>. Give B.B.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Stings of Bees, Hornets, &#38;c.</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes where a horse has been tied near a swarm
of bees, if sweaty or offensive to them, the swarm has been
known to attack him, producing pain, inflammation,
swelling, and sometimes death. Hornets are as bad or
worse. Apply freely <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>.
Give A.A., fifteen drops, and repeat it every hour.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE FEET AND LEGS</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Lameness</h4>

<p class='c010'>The adage “No roof, no house,” is matched by “No
foot, no horse,” because in either case the value of the
thing is measured by the part that is wanting. So lameness
or its absence is the essential part to be looked after
in a horse. Fortunately it is not always necessary to
decide in our practice the precise point, structure, tendon
or muscle involved in order to cure, but it is always
desirable. Hence the following points are suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the lameness has come on <i>suddenly</i> during a drive or
work, it suggests some accident, or other very recent
cause, such as <i>picking up a nail</i> or a <i>stone</i>, a <i>bruise of the
sole</i>, an <i>over-reach</i>, or a <i>strain</i> of a <i>tendon or joint</i>. If it
has come on <i>slowly</i> or <i>gradually</i>, it would suggest some
more deep-seated or constitutional cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>If it occurs of having been out, or worked in cold
rains, or after work standing uncovered in a cold chill
wind, it suggests <i>rheumatism</i> or rheumatic lameness, or
<i>laminitis</i>, “founder of the feet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An examination must always be made quietly. If the
horse is excited you are liable to be put upon the wrong
track. If the <i>fore feet</i> are affected the hind feet will be
likely to be brought far forward in order to take the
weight off the sore place. If one fore foot <i>points</i> or is
advanced some inches beyond the other, it suggests some
difficulty in the heel of that foot or back part of that
limb; while, bending the knee and fetlock, and resting
the foot or the toe without advancing it, suggests a
disease of the shoulder or elbow. In all cases of lameness
of <i>one foot</i>, that one will rest more lightly on the
ground, and be raised more quickly than the other. In
exercise when one limb is affected, that foot comes to
the ground less heavily than the other, and the head and
fore part of the body are elevated, when it comes down
and drops again when the sound foot comes down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>With lameness in <i>both</i> fore feet the <i>step is short</i>, and the
stroke on the ground weak, the shoulders stiff, head
raised, and hind feet brought unnaturally forward. In
lameness on <i>one side behind</i> the rising and falling of the
hip on the affected side is more marked than on the
sound side. When <i>both sides</i> behind are involved, the
fore feet will be kept well back under the animal to
relieve the weight. With these hints in mind the location
of the trouble may be usually ascertained and the
treatment by external applications facilitated. Consult
also the special form of lameness or disease which the
examination has indicated as the directions or hints
given therein may be valuable as <i>sprain</i>, <i>rheumatism</i>,
<i>bruises</i>, <i>corns</i>, <i>stifle</i>, <i>founder</i>, <i>spavin</i>, <i>splint</i>, <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In general, when the point of difficulty is
known, and if recent, the place swollen, or heated, apply
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> diluted one-half with
water, two or three, or more times per day. In severe
cases, put on a compress wet with diluted <span class='sc'>Marvel</span>, which
renew as often as it gets dry, and give A.A., if there is
much heat or fever in the part, a dose say four times per
day. When the heat has subsided, or if there is no
special fever or heat apparent, give B.B. as often at first,
and later or in more indolent or chronic cases a dose
morning and night. Later, and especially if the lameness
is worse on first morning, give I.I. in place of B.B.,
or alternate the one morning and the other night.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Veterinary Oil</span>, may be used after the use of the
<span class='sc'>Marvel</span>, or when there is local swelling, bruise, or any
<i>chafing</i>, <i>cut</i>, <i>scratch</i>, or <i>ulceration</i> or for <i>bruised</i> or <i>broken
hoof</i> or <i>corn</i>. Apply it daily.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Laminitis, Inflammation of the Feet or Founder</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is one of the most frequent diseases of the horse,
and one in which the resources of my <span class='sc'>Homeopathic
Remedies</span> are very efficient. The sensible lamina or fleshy
plates on the front and sides of the coffin-bone, are, like
all other vascular structures, very liable to inflammation,
particularly from violence or long continued action of the
part. Hence, standing long in one position, as in sea-voyages;
battering or bruising the feet in severe or long
journeys; sudden changes from heat to cold, or from cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>to heat, acting directly oil the feet; standing in snow or
cold water after a journey, are the more common causes
of this disease. It sometimes occurs as a mere transition
of the disease from some other part, and occasionally from
<i>excess of food or indigestible food</i>, or <i>food when heated</i>.
Many cases of so called <span class='sc'>Founder</span> are really only attacks
of <i>Acute Rheumatism</i>; hence consult what is said on that
disease, and compare the two chapters for a better understanding
of the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease generally begins with a
shivering, shaking chill; the flanks heave; the breathing
becomes quick and labored; the pulse full and frequent;
the horse shifts his feet from one place to another; lies
down and rises frequently, but does not paw the ground
nor kick his belly; he will sometimes place his lips on the
fevered feet, as if to tell where his pain is; he places his
hind legs under him, as if to take the weight of his body
from the fore-feet; he moans or groans from the severity
of the pain and at last lies down, unable to stand upon the
inflamed feet. The feet are intensely hot and painful. If
one foot is taken up, he can scarcely stand upon the other
and may tumble down. He does not like to get up from
the ground, and is moved with difficulty from one place
to another. If the disease be not arrested, matter may
form inside the hoof, which even may be thrown off.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disease may exist in a more chronic form, coming
on by degrees, and eventually resulting in the ruin of the
horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is more common to see it in a milder form than the
first mentioned presenting the following symptoms: The
horse is feverish, out of spirits, refuses to eat, cannot raise
his limbs without evincing pain, trails his feet along with
difficulty; cannot readily be made to go forward, or backward
scarcely at all. In the stable, horses bring the four
feet near together, and there is no little difficulty in
making them relinquish this attitude.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In the more severe cases, the shoes should
be removed from the feet, and the hoof pared down until
the horn yields to the pressure of the thumb. Give the
horse rest, and allow him to lie down, wrap the hoofs in
cloths soaked in water, and renew them from time to time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>If the disease is from the feet having been battered by
long driving or riding, bathing them with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Marvel Witch Hazel</span> will be of great value. In some
cases, a cold poultice, made of mashed turnips or carrots,
is of excellent service.</p>

<p class='c004'>The remedy is B.B., of which a dose may be given every
three hours, in acute cases. In recent cases, when there
is <i>fever</i>, <i>decided lameness</i> and <i>heat of the foot</i>, and indeed in
almost every case, you may better begin with A.A., of
which give a dose every two hours, and after three or four
doses, alternate with B.B., as often as every two hours,
and after the force of the disease has abated, the B.B.,
may be continued alone at increasing intervals, until
entire restoration.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the disease is clearly traceable to <i>over-feeding</i>, the
B.B. and J.K., may be alternated from the first, every
three or four hours, in doses of fifteen drops.</p>

<p class='c004'>In case of chronic founder, the B.B. should be given,
a dose of fifteen drops, each morning and night, and the
treatment continued for some time. An occasional dose
of J.K. will be useful as a constitutional intercurrent
remedy, and may be given at noon, while the B.B. is
given morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>On the Formation of Joints</h4>

<p class='c010'>Joints are formed of bones which fit into each other by
unequal surfaces, whose cavities and eminences mutually
correspond. As the roughness of the bones would prevent
their moving freely without friction, we find an intervening
smooth elastic substance called cartilage, which not only
obviates this inconvenience, but in a great measure takes
off the jar that would otherwise ensue when the horse
moves on hard ground. To render the motion still easier,
we find the cartilage covered with a fine synovial membrane,
secreting a fluid of an albuminous and oily
character, which acts in the same capacity as oil to
machinery, namely, to prevent friction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Besides the membranous connection of bones which
enter into the formation of joints, there are strong, flexible
substances of a fibrous texture called ligaments, which are
the chief bond of attachment, and support the lower joints;
while others are further strengthened by muscles and
tendons. Bursæ mucosæ are small closed sacs which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>surround the tendons wherever there is friction; they
are analogous in structure to the synovial membrane,
and secrete a similar fluid.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Synovitis</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Idiopathic or constitutional inflammation
of the synovial membranes. The inflamed membranes
never extend beyond a certain size, nor do they burst,
nor do they terminate healthily without treatment, but
remain in the same condition from year to year. The
inflamed condition is most frequently observed at the
hock, when it is called Bog-spavin and Thorough-pin.
But it is also found affecting the knee and fetlock, and
in the latter case is sometimes confounded with Windgalls,
which are inflamed bursæ mucosæ.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Rheumatic Fever; exposure to heat and cold;
also friction from quick work on a hard road; sprains.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Lameness quickly succeeded by swelling of
some joints, not of the surrounding fibrous texture, as in
true Rheumatism; the swelling in this disease is in the
synovial cavity, and the effusion is at first generally
serous and unattended by the fever which ushers in the
muscular or fibrous Rheumatism. As the inflammation
proceeds, coagulable lymph may be thrown out and the
joint be permanently enlarged, or, from adhesions, the
horse be left with a stiff joint.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Give</span> A.A., four times per day at first, then B.B.,
morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ulceration of Articular Cartilage</h4>

<p class='c010'>The inflammation in the synovial membrane sometimes
extends to the cartilage, covering the ends of the tibia or
astragalus. In such cases there is a diminution of the
synovial secretion, also ulceration and wearing away of
the cartilage, and a polishing of the surface of the bone,
which has been erroneously called a porcelaineous deposit.
We have seen this ulceration of the cartilage, and even
caries of the bone, in the navicular more commonly than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>in the bones of the hock; but not a few cases of occult
lameness in the hock may be attributed to it. Give B.B.
two or three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Windgalls—Puffs</h4>

<p class='c010'>In the region of the joints, and wherever friction is likely
to take place, we find the tendons supplied with little sacs
(<i>bursæ mucosæ</i>) composed of membrane similar to the
synovial, and secreting in health an oily fluid from their
internal surface, in very small quantities; but when the
tendons become strained, or increased action is set up in
them from over-exertion, nature comes to the rescue by
increasing the bursal secretion, and we then perceive a
slight elastic tumor, called <i>Windgall</i> or <i>Puff</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Tendinous sprains or over-exertion of any
kind, and long continued friction from quick work on
hard roads. Low, marshy pastures seem to have a tendency
sometimes to produce a dropsical effusion in and around
the joints of young horses, very similar to the enlarged
bursæ from hard work; but they soon yield to constitutional
treatment.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Soft, elastic, circumscribed swellings, at
first about the size of a nut, but eventually becoming
hard and much larger, which appear in the neighborhood
of some of the joints, such as the knee, hock, or
fetlock. To the latter, however, the name is usually
restricted, although equally applicable to the former; so
that when we say that a horse has Windgalls, we mean
that he has above, or on each side of, the fetlock, or
back sinew, one or more elastic tumors, usually unattended
by lameness or any active inflammation. The
seat of these bursal enlargements is either between the
perforatus and perforans tendons, or between the latter
and the suspensory ligament. There is, however, another
fetlock Windgall found on the front of the joints, between
it and the extensor tendon; and a similar swelling occurs
at the supero-posterior part of the knee from the distension
of the bursa, between the perforatus and perforans tendons.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><span class='sc'>Pathology.</span>—These enlargements were formerly supposed
to contain wind, and so obtained their absurd name;
but, from what has been already stated, the reader will
perceive that they consist in an increase of bursal fluid
similar to joint oil, and in a majority of cases do no harm,
but are rather to be considered as a beautiful provision of
Nature to obviate the baneful effects of friction from over-exertion
of the muscles and tendons. Morbid changes,
however, do occasionally take place in the bursæ, either
from inordinate increase of their contents setting up
inflammation in their tissue, or from an extension of the
inflammation to contiguous parts, in which not only the
bursal sacs, but also the lining membrane of the tendinous
sheath, participate, when we find the puffy swelling extending
up the leg, above the ordinary seat of Windgall,
and very tender on pressure. The effect of this inflammation
on the bursæ mucosæ is to cause a thickening of
the membrane and a total change in the contents of the
sac; the fluid, instead of being a straw-color, becomes
reddened from the effusion of blood, which, after death,
we find clotted and of a dark color. Lymph also is occasionally
effused, giving the tumor a firm, hard feel, which,
from calcareous deposits, produces lameness.</p>

<p class='c004'>I.I., given morning and night, often clears up these
blemishes wonderfully.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Seedy Toe</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disorder, frequently a sequel to laminitis, often
arises without any assignable cause. It can sometimes
be attributed to the clip of the shoe pressing on a hoof
predisposed to the disease from deficiency in its natural
glutinous secretions, whereby the horn becomes dry and
loses its cohesive property, and is unable to resist the
pressure from the toe clip, which a healthy hoof would do
with impunity. It may also be consequent on gravel or
dirt working in at the edge of the sole.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The horn at the toe (of the fore-feet of
troop and riding horses, but frequently the hind feet of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>cart horses) becomes “seedy,” and crumbles away like so
much saw-dust or the dry rot in wood; while at the
junction between the wall and sole a fissure will be
apparent, leading upward between the outer and inner
crusts of the wall, sometimes extending up to the coronet,
and in old cases laterally, so that there is some difficulty
in finding a piece of horn sufficiently sound to hold a nail,
and side clips become necessary in keeping the shoe on.
Percussion on the wall of the hoof with a hammer will
show to what extent the separation has taken place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The whole of the crust, as far as it is
separated from the horny laminæ underneath, must be
cut away, and the foot bound up with tar, tow, and broad
tape. <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> applied to the coronet will hasten
the downward growth of the wall. Keep the horse standing
in clay, daily anointing the hoof with <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>.
Both means have been successfully tried. Give J.K.
morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Navicular Joint Disease</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is far more frequent than is usually
supposed, and many horses are ruined by it, the lameness
being generally referred to the shoulder or to some other
part not at all in fault.</p>

<p class='c004'>Behind and beneath the lower pastern bone in the heel
of the horse, and behind and above the heel of the coffin-bone,
is a small bone called the navicular, or shuttle-bone.
It is so placed as to strengthen the union between the lower
pastern and coffin-bone, and to enable the flexor tendon
which passes over it to be inserted into the bottom of the
coffin-bone and to act with more advantage. It thus forms
a kind of joint with that tendon. There is a great deal of
weight thrown on this bone and from this navicular bone
on the tendon, and there is considerable motion or play
between them in the bending and extension of the
pasterns.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is easy to conceive that from sudden concussion or
from rapid and over-strained motion, and at a time when,
from rest and relaxation, the parts have not adapted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>themselves to the violent motion required, there may be
excessive play between the bone and tendon, and the
delicate membrane which covers the bone or the cartilage
of the bone, may become bruised, inflamed and injured,
or destroyed, and that all the painful effects of an inflamed
and open joint may result, and the horse be incurably
lame. Numerous dissections have shown that this joint
thus formed by the tendon and bone, has been the frequent
and almost invariable seat of these obscure lamenesses.
The membrane covering the cartilage becomes inflamed
and ulcerated; the cartilage itself is ulcerated and eaten
away, the bone has become carious, and bony adhesions
have taken place between the navicular and pastern and
coffin-bones, and this part of the foot has become completely
disorganized and useless.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The degree of lameness is various; the
horse may show lameness the first hundred steps, or the
first mile or two, and then less or scarcely at all; he is
inclined to “point” or keep the affected foot in advance
of the other when standing; he may show lameness on
stone or pavement and not on turf or ground; if both
feet are badly affected, the horse favors his heels, has
short action, and wears away the toes of his slices, leaving
the heels undiminished in thickness; the hind feet
may be kept well under him to diminish the pressure
upon the fore-feet; in the stable, he is mostly lying
down; heat of the foot and heel, especially the heel.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In the earlier stages when there exists
only irritation and inflammation, and no changes of
structure or disorganizations have yet occurred, the A.A.,
together with cold applications kept to the foot will be
sufficient. Give a dose of fifteen drops four times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>In more extreme or advanced cases, the sole should be
pared down and the quarters rasped, and shoe worn
without nails on the inner quarter, to unbind as far as
possible the imprisoned bone, and the foot kept
anointed with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, and the use of B.B.,
the main remedy. These will be successful in the incipient
or milder stages of the disease and will vastly
benefit old or chronic cases.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Sand Crack, Quarter Crack</h4>

<p class='c010'>That is a separation of the fibres of the hoof from above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>downward—rarely crosswise. The usual treatment is to
drill two holes through <i>each side of the crack</i> and then
pass copper or iron wire through them. Both ends of the
wire are then drawn and clinched down and fastened in
the same way as the nails in shoeing. The crack itself is
then to be filled with cobbler’s wax after having been
thoroughly cleaned out. Give also, ten drops of the J.K.,
morning and night, to promote the growth of the hoof.</p>

<p class='c004'>A yet better method is to properly prepare a <i>horse shoe
nail</i> by cutting <i>bards along in it</i>, <i>from head to point</i>. Then
drive the nail from one side of the crack through to and
beyond the other at least half an inch from the crack.
The clinching of the point of the nail will drive the bards
back and firmly fasten them, and the head and point
may be filed down and smoothed off. A long crack should
have two nails. The shoe should be so fitted and the hoof
so pared away, as to <i>take the bearing off from the cracked
portion</i>, and as the hoof again grows down, it should be
again <i>cut away between the hoof and shoe with a saw</i>, so as
to keep the bearing of the cracked part of the hoof free.
You thus rivet the broken parts together, and by taking
off the strain allow the crack to grow out, and heal up.
Of course a horse with a quarter crack should only be put
to the most moderate work, if any, as violent exercise or
hard work will be sure to aggravate and increase the difficulty,
and may render a cure impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quarter crack only occurs when some brittleness or
defective horny growth is present. Correct this defect by
giving the J.K., fifteen drops, morning and night, and
apply <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span> to the crack as often.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Corns</h4>

<p class='c010'>A corn is a bruise upon the sole of the foot at the angle
between the wall and the bar, and has this resemblance
to the corn in the human subject, that it is produced by
pressure and results in lameness. It may be caused by
contracted feet; cutting away the bars: too thick-heeled
shoes or weak, flat feet; dirt getting between the shoe
and heel of the foot; or from not having the foot
sufficiently pared out.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The pressure arising from these causes produces
an irritation, congestion, soreness, and even
extravasation of blood under the horn, with often a
reddish appearance and a softer feel than other parts of
the sole. The place is painful when pressed upon, the
horse flinches and is more or less lame. In bad cases
matter may form, and unless a vent is made, may underrun
the sole or appear at the coronet in the form of a
Quittor.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In most cases, simply apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span> to the sore place night and morning after having
properly cleansed the foot. See that the shoe does not
press upon the sore place, but has its bearing upon the
outer crust of the hoof. If matter has formed under the
corn, the dead horn may be removed and a vent made
and a poultice applied to soften and discharge the matter,
after which apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> until the soreness
is removed. Give I.I. mornings and J.K. at night, and
keep the <span class='sc'>Oil</span> applied to the surface. Change the poultice
and dressing each night and morning. In a few days the
foot will be ready to shoe in the usual way, using, however,
a leather sole to keep out the dirt. If a quittor has
formed, it should be treated as such.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Prick in the Foot</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sharp substances, such as nails, glass, pointed stones,
or similar substances, not unfrequently penetrate the
foot in traveling, or the shoe may be partly torn off, and
the loosened nail be thrust into the foot, or a nail may
go wrong in shoeing.</p>

<p class='c004'>When a sharp pointed object is picked up on the road,
it may enter the toe of the frog and wound the navicular
joint, or the flexor, at its insertion into the pedal bone,
and let out the “joint oil,” in which case there is danger
of permanent injury. The wound may lie further back,
and be in the bulbous heels or cushion of the frog; in
this case there is less danger.</p>

<p class='c004'>In shoeing, the nail may be driven too near the laminæ,
or even wound them; in the latter case the horse <i>will
flinch</i>; in the former he may not feel the nail till he <i>puts
his foot to the ground</i>. If on the day after shoeing he
walks lame, the foot is hot to the touch, the horse flinches
when the crust is tapped with a hammer, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>where there is a nail, it may be assumed that the shoeing
is at fault.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Lameness, with heat in the foot and tenderness
on pressure. In some cases, no matter will be found,
but in others a black serous or purulent discharge will
issue from the wound when opened, and the sole will
probably be underrun.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If there is simply <i>heat of the foot</i> and
<i>lameness</i>, remove the shoe, see that all nails or parts of
nails, or other foreign substance is taken out. Apply and
keep the foot wet with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch
Hazel</span> and give the A.A., once in three hours, to reduce
the inflammation. If matter has formed, <span class='fss'>LET IT OUT</span>.
Apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> to the hole or orifice, and
give A.A. and B.B., in alternation, a dose four times per
day, and later the B.B. and I.I., to dry up the discharge.
If the horse is required for work before the horn has
covered the wound, a leather sole and the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span> dressing must be used.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Quittor</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a deep, narrow ulcer, opening upon the coronet,
and leading into an abscess in the foot. It may be
caused by treads, or overreaches, or corns, but most
commonly from prick of a nail or other sharp substance.
It is attended with more or less lameness; heat and pain
in the foot, and discharge of matter from the open wound.
But if it has been caused by the matter from a corn, the
coronet above the heel will have upon it a hard, painful
swelling, which afterward becomes softer and larger.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If the quittor arises from a wound of the
sole or prick, after the wounded part has been pared out
and poulticed, then with a probe gently find out the
direction and number of pipes, and with a fine syringe,
inject <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> of full strength
into the opening, two or three times per day. The <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span> is better if you can get it into the opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it arises from a corn in the heel, and matter
has got into the coronet, the swelling must be cut into
and the discharge let out; then poultice night and morning,
inject the <span class='sc'>Marvel</span> as before, rasp down the wall of
the hoof until it yields to the pressure of the thumb, and
put on a bar-shoe. Roll a bandage around the coronet
to keep the dirt out from the quittor.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>If there is some considerable heat and fever, the A.A.,
may come in play giving fifteen drops four times per day.
But the I.I., should be given, fifteen drops three times
per day, at first, and then morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Spavin</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is an affection of the tendons, ligaments, and
bursa connected with the hock. From a strain, violent
exercise, or similar cause, an increased action is set up
in these parts which glide upon each other, irritation
results and the parts enlarge. Or, an exudation of serum
occurs, tinged or not with blood, which may be absorbed
afterward or remain for a long time a soft movable
tumor; or by degrees an ossific or bony deposit takes
place, resulting in a firm, hard, bony tumor. These
several stages or degrees of the same common affection
have been termed <i>Bog-Spavin</i>, <i>Blood-Spavin</i>, and <i>Bone-Spavin</i>.
Windgalls and Thorough Pins are but local
variations of the same essential condition—enlargements
of the bursa and tendons of the joint. It usually shows
itself on the inner and lower side of the hock at the lower
portion of the joint. A careful comparison of the two legs
with the eye and hand will best disclose the evil. “Sometimes
it appears as a soft swelling of the femoral vein along
the inner surface of the hock. Or, again, as a hot, painful,
lameing swelling, extending from the posterior border of
the hock downward, which may afterward become a hard,
bony tumor, insensible, causing the animal to limp only
when making some exertion. Or, the swelling extends
along the inner surface of the hock, oblong, a little broader
above than below, bony, sometimes involving the entire
joint, and occasioning more or less limping. Or a soft
round swelling over the whole internal surface of the hock,
at first not impeding the horse’s gait, but afterward becoming
indurated and causing a rigidity of the hock and
consequent lameness. Or a hard osseous swelling at the
upper and inner side of the femur, causing a lameness
depending upon the extent to which the ligaments of the
joints are involved.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At first the animal seems afraid to use one or the other
of the hind legs, and a little lameness is noticed on first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>starting off. Afterward, when returning to the stable after
exertion, the horse stands on the toe of the affected limb,
and limps considerably on turning around and first commencing
to walk; after moving a little, the lameness
disappears, and only returns again after he has been
standing some time. This will soon be followed by swelling.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—There is a predisposition to this affection in
some families of horses, and when this predisposition
exists, strains, violent exertion, over-work, a blow or
other injury, readily develops the spavin. Horses with
high legs, from three to seven years of age, are most
liable to it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In the earlier stages, while the lameness
is yet recent, and little or no swelling has appeared,
bathing the joint with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>
and giving B.B., night and morning, doses of fifteen
drops, will be sufficient to remove the lameness and
generally prevent the swelling. When the swelling is
still soft and recent, bathing the joint with <span class='sc'>The Marvel</span>
and giving the B.B., night and morning, will reduce the
swelling and relieve the lameness.</p>

<p class='c004'>In all other cases of spavin, whatever may be its
particular form or situation, give fifteen drops of B.B.,
each morning and night, see that the legs are well
rubbed, with but moderate daily work or exercise.
The pain, lameness, and subsequent exudation of bony
matter depend upon the affection of the ligaments of the
joint. This being relieved, the whole affection disappears.
All recent and soft spavins may be successfully treated
thus, and even the most inveterate ones will be relieved
and benefited. It is not pretended or presumed that old
chronic, years’ standing spavins, when there are extensive
ossific dispositions or necrosis, are to be caused to disappear
by this or any medicine. But all those incipient
cases may be thus cured and even the old enlargements
vastly improved.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Splint</h4>

<p class='c010'>In consequence of an injury a bony tumor arises in the
inside of the fore-leg below the knee; sometimes, though
rarely, it is seen on the outside, and even on the hind
legs. After having existed some time, they seldom
occasion lameness, except so situated as to interfere with
the action of the tendons or ligaments of the legs. During
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the forming stage, the horse is lame because the periosteum
or covering of the bone is inflamed, but after this has
subsided and the bony exudation is thrown out, it disappears,
except in the case above mentioned. In some
cases, in the beginning, the feet are hot and painful, the
animal likes to remain lying down; and if only the fore-feet
are affected, he puts them down with great care and
evident pain, and there is general fever and suffering,
which passes off with the more decided local manifestation.
If the tumor is of some standing, it may be quite difficult
or impossible to cause its disappearance. But happily
these old hardened tumors seldom interfere with the
essential usefulness of the animal.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In most cases if there is heat and feverish
excitement of the system, give fifteen drops of A.A., and
B.B., alternately, five times per day, that is, a dose of
B.B. morning, noon and night, and a dose of A.A., at
say ten o’clock in the forenoon and at three in the afternoon,
until the heat and lameness are partially subdued,
and then give B.B., morning and night, until the lameness
and irritation have entirely subsided. Old cases
may only require a dose every day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ring Bone</h4>

<p class='c010'>Consists of an enlargement and ossific deposit (near the
fetlock joint) in consequence of a strain and inflammatory
action. It may appear on one or both sides of the foot,
or completely surround it, giving rise to the name. One
or more feet may be affected by it. It is generally recognized
by a mere bony enlargement on one or both sides
of the pastern, and the lameness is not very considerable.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—At the commencement bathe the part
with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> or <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span> from day to day, and give fifteen drops of B.B.,
three times a day. In chronic cases, give a dose morning
and night, or even only once per day. Cases of considerable
standing will materially improve, and recent or fresh
cases may be permanently restored.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Thrush and Canker</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is an inflammation of the lower surface of
the sensible frog, which secretes matter of a peculiar
offensive smell, instead of healthy horn. The matter issues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>from the cleft of the frog. In a sound frog the cleft is
shallow, but when contracted or otherwise diseased, the
cleft deepens even to the sensible horn within, and through
this the matter issues. Afterwards the discharge becomes
more abundant and offensive; the frog wears off and a
fresh growth of horn fails to appear. It then becomes
thin, shriveled, contracted and fissured; and as the
disease extends, the matter becomes still more fetid, and
may terminate in a yet more unmanageable form of
disease, namely, <i>canker</i>. In Thrush, the frog is painful
when pressed upon by the thumb or pincers, or when
the animal treads upon a stone. As a consequence of
neglected thrush, the horn may separate from the sensible
part of the foot, and unhealthy vegetations, proud flesh,
fungous matter spring up, occupying a portion or the
whole of the sole of the frog, and finally involving frog,
sole and bars, in a mass of putrefaction, constituting the
worst form of <i>canker</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—As thrush is often caused by uncleanliness
and constant moisture of the feet, the greatest care must
be taken to keep them dry and clean, and especially from
dung and urine. If connected with contracted fore-feet,
particular care must be given to shoeing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frog should be carefully pared down and all loose,
ragged portions removed in order to prevent the accumulation
of matter and dirt. The discharge wiped off by
means of a tow pressed down into the cleft with a thin
piece of wood. Then smear the frog and cleft with a
mixture composed of half an ounce of <i>sulphate of copper</i>
(blue vitriol) and six ounces of tar made into a paste or
the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>. A small piece of tow dipped in this
mixture should also be placed in the cleft, or in whatever
part of the frog a sinus, hole or cleft exists. In bad
cases, repeat the dressing daily; in others, once in two or
three days is sufficient. If the dressing is properly applied
it will not fall out or admit the entrance of dirt. Should
the frog be extensively diseased, a bar-shoe may be
necessary, and the dressing will then be kept in place by
the cross bar of iron, or a leather sole may be used under
the shoe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Throughout the treatment give fifteen drops of I.I.,
each morning and fifteen drops of J.K., every night, for
the growth of healthy hoof.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE EYES</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Albugo, or Spot in the Eye, Opacity of the Cornea</h4>

<p class='c010'>In consequence of a blow, stroke of a whip, or similar
injury, an inflammatory action is set up in the eye, the
result of which is an effusion of serum between the
lamina of the outer coating of the eye, which renders
the cornea or clear part of the eye, whitish or opaque in
spots, interfering materially with the sight and usefulness
of the organ. But little can be done to remove those of
long standing, but recent cases, or those where inflammation
is just subsiding and the opacity only forming,
will be dispelled by frequently bathing the eye with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, and giving fifteen
drops of A.A., three times per day. In many cases of
opacity a portion of soft honey, the size of a small pea,
put in the eye daily, has been known to have a wonderful
effect in removing such opacities.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Amaurosis, Gutta Serena</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease consists in entire or partial loss of vision
in consequence of paralysis of the optic nerve, or interruption
of its communication with the brain. Injuries of
the head, or ball of the eye, or some disease of the brain,
are the usual causes. The horse walks cautiously, head
elevated, and ears move quickly backward and forward,
the eye has a peculiar glassy appearance, and the pupil
does not dilate and contract when light is brought near
or removed from the eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>But little can be done for these cases. In the earlier
stages a dose of A.A., may possibly arrest its progress,
but generally it is incurable in man or beast.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Cataract</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In consequence of injuries to the eye, blows, contusions,
etc., or as a consequence of severe and repeated inflammation,
the crystalline lens becomes opaque so as to
interfere with or altogether destroy the sight. On
examining the eye, deep in the pupil, a whitish, yellowish,
or brownish body is discoverable. Sometimes, especially
in the commencement, white streaks run from the center
outward, or the whole chamber within the pupil looks
dim and whitish.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Cataracts are incurable, but recent and forming
cases may be benefited by giving A.A. and B.B., a dose
of fifteen drops, every night, alternately.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ophthalmia, Inflammation of the Eye</h4>

<p class='c010'>There are in the horse two well marked forms of sore or
inflamed eyes. <span class='sc'>Acute Ophthalmia</span> and <span class='sc'>Periodic</span> or <span class='sc'>Moon
Blindness</span>. Acute inflammation occurs usually in consequence
of some irritating substance, hay seed, dust, etc.,
having got into the eye, or from overheating, heated
foot, or from hereditary predisposition.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—It comes on with heat and uneasiness, the
animal keeps the eye closed, or dreads the light, the eye-ball
and inside of the lid look red, and the ball is protruded
and the eye secretes a quantity of water, which
runs down on the cheek, or of humor, which becomes
purulent, and glues the lids together. The cornea is dim
and whitish, or covered with a scum, the haw is swollen
and red.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Examine the eye for dirt, hay seed, hair,
or other substances, and if found, carefully remove them.
They are more frequently under the upper lid, which
may be turned inside out over the point of the finger,
by taking the lashes between the finger and thumb, and
turning the lid upward. The eyes should be bathed with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, diluted one-half
with water, or if this be not at hand, make a lotion by
putting four or five drops of A.A., in a half-pint of pure,
soft water, and the eye should be bathed with this two
or three times per day, so long as the heat and swelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>exist. Give at the same time, in recent cases, fifteen
drops of A.A., four times per day, and in old cases the
same dose morning and night. Arnica is of little consequence,
except where the inflammation is the result of a
bruise.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Periodic Ophthalmia</span> is really a general affection, the
result of teething, and usually appears on the cutting of
the middle incisors, the molars, and tusks, and hence, at
the age of from three to five years.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Generally only one eye is attacked; the eye
looks smaller, swims in tears, and is sensitive to the
light, the cornea becomes dim and leaden, and the lens
look gray. The pulse is full and frequent; the mouth
hot, tongue dry, the water scanty and bowels constipated.
There is evidently feverish excitement of the system and
congestion of the blood to the head. Not unfrequently
the inflammation passes from one eye to the other.
Severe or repeated attacks are very apt to return again or
leave as results, dimness of the cornea, opacity of the
lens or cataract behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Exclude the animal from the glare of the
light, and give at once ten drops of A.A., every four or
six hours. Bathe the eye from time to time with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> diluted with an equal
quantity of soft water, or with the lotion mentioned in
the case of Acute Ophthalmia. Keep him on low diet
and the case will generally be soon relieved. As the eye
improves, the intervals between the doses of medicine
should be prolonged. Often a dose night and morning is
sufficient. Given early it will prevent the development
of serious consequences.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>The Haw</h4>

<p class='c010'>We mention in this connection a curious mechanism of
the eye more to guard against abuses than to cure disease.
Concealed within the inner corner of the eye, the
margin only visible, is a black or pied triangular-shapen
cartilage called <span class='sc'>The Haw</span>, with its broad part forward.
It is concave, exactly to suit the globe of the eye, and
convex without, so as to adapt itself to the mucous lining
of the lid, and the base of it is reduced to a thin, sharp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>edge. At the will of the animal this is rapidly protruded
from its hiding place, and passing swiftly over the eye,
shovels up every nuisance mixed with tears, and then
being suddenly drawn back, the dust or insect is wiped
away as the haw again passes under the corner of the eye.
The haw is subject in common with other parts of the
eye to inflammation and swelling and senseless grooms
term this “the <span class='sc'>Hooks</span>,” and have been known to draw
the haw out and cut it off, to the lasting injury of the
organ.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such an inflammation only requires the usual treatment,
and will be subdued by bathing the eye with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, diluted one-half
water, and giving A.A. internally, ten drops as a dose
and repeated morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Injuries to the Eye</h4>

<p class='c010'>Must be treated both internally and externally.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Remedies.</span>—<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> and
A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <span class='sc'>Marvel</span>, if the injury has been produced by a
mechanical cause, as blows from a whip, punctures, etc.,
and there is much soreness and inflammation, it should
be applied externally, in the form of a lotion of one part
of <span class='sc'>Marvel</span> to three parts of water, and the injured part
bathed three times a day, at the same time A.A. should
be given internally.</p>

<p class='c004'>The A.A. should be given, if there is much inflammation,
or the eye is congested.</p>

<p class='c004'>H.H. may be used later, if there is any dimness of the
eye left.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes pieces of hay or chaff get into the eye and
cause a great deal of irritation; of course the first thing
to be done is to carefully remove them, and then apply
the <span class='sc'>Marvel</span>, diluted with half water, which, in the
majority of cases, is all that is necessary to be done.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Structure and Action of the Heart</h4>

<p class='c010'>Before entering on a description of the diseases of the
Heart, it may be well to give a brief description of that
organ and its functions, for the benefit of non-professional
readers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The heart is placed in the center of the thorax, in the
space between the lungs, and opposite the third, fourth,
fifth and sixth ribs. It may be described as a muscular
forcing pump, for the transmission of blood to all parts of
the body. The texture of the heart is muscular, with
tendinous or cartilaginous bands around the openings
between the auricles and ventricles, and between the
latter and the arteries. It contains four chambers, viz.:
two auricles and two ventricles; each auricle communicates
with its corresponding ventricle; but the auricles do
not communicate with each other, nor do the ventricles.
The opening in each pair is guarded by a little valve, in
order to ensure the flow of blood in one direction, and to
prevent any regurgitation or re-flow from the ventricles
into the auricles. We find valves for a similar purpose
placed at the origin of the pulmonary artery and the aorta,
which proceed from the right and left ventricles, and are
the channels by which the blood flows through the former
to the lungs, through the latter to the general circulation.
The chambers of the heart are lined by a smooth membrane
of a serous character, called the endocardium,
which is often the seat of disease; and the whole is enclosed
in a fibro-serous sac, called the pericardium.</p>

<p class='c004'>On examining the heart, it will be found externally
divided by a furrow, which corresponds with a muscular
septum, dividing the organ into two parts, or two hearts,
having no direct communication with one another, except
in the fetus. The right side, whose parts are thinner
than the left, may be called the venous heart, as it receives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the blood in an impure state from the veins, and transmits
it through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it
becomes exposed to the atmosphere, and converted from
venous into arterial blood. It is then conveyed by the
pulmonary arteries to the left auricle and ventricle, whence
it is propelled through the aorta and its branches to all
parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dimension and weight of a healthy heart vary so
much that it is not possible to give them accurately, but
the average is stated as follows by Mr. Walsh: “It is
about ten and a quarter inches from the base to the apex,
seven inches in its antero-posterior diameter, and five and
a quarter from side to side. In weight, it varies from six
and a half to seven pounds. The auricles have much
thinner walls than the ventricles, and the muscular substance
or the left ventricle, occupying the apex of the
heart, is very much thicker than that of the right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The nerves which supply the heart are the pneumogastric
and sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c004'>Idiopathic disease of the heart in the equine race is a
very rare occurrence; but, as a consequence or accompaniment
of influenza and fevers of a low type, is by no
means uncommon; it is therefore of importance that we
should know how to diagnose both the organic and functional
derangement of so important an organ, which can
only be done by making ourselves familiar with.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Action of the Heart in Health.</span>—There are three
means by which this knowledge may be attained: first, by
<i>Percussion</i>, which, in the human subject, affords an index
to the size and position of the heart; but in consequence
of the less exposed position of that organ in the horse, is
of little value, except in diagnosing Hydrops Pericardii.
Second, by <i>Impulse</i>, or the force of the beat imparted to
the hand placed flat on the near side of the chest, just
behind the elbow. Third, by <i>Auscultation</i>, which is the
only reliable way of ascertaining the condition of the heart,
and consists in placing one ear, or a stethoscope, in the
same position as that already described. Two distinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>sounds can be heard; the first, termed the “systolic,”
is louder and more prolonged than the second (which
immediately follows), and seems to depend upon the
contraction of the ventricle; during this contraction the
organ elongates and rotates on its axis from right to left,
thus producing the impulse and sound on the left side of
the thorax. The second, “diastolic,” or “flapping,”
sound, cannot be heard in a fat, circular-chested horse;
it is supposed to arise from the regurgitation of the blood,
which is in the aorta and pulmonary arteries, forcibly
closing the valves placed at their origin in the ventricles,
so as to prevent the blood coming back into the heart.
These sounds together form what is called the “beat,”
and are succeeded by a brief interval of repose. In the
healthy animal these beats are uniform and regular,
corresponding with the pulse; but in disease there may
be, first, increase or diminution in the frequency and
strength of the beats; second, irregular or intermittent
action of the heart. In the latter case, we hear two or
three beats in quick succession, and then a longer interval
of repose than is natural, followed by the consecutive,
quick beats and long repose, the number of the
former and duration of the latter being singularly
uniform. Third, the systolic and diastolic sounds may
increase, diminish, or be succeeded by other sounds
indicative of disease hereafter described.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pericarditis—Dropsy of the Heart</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Inflammation of the fibro-serous membrane
which invests the heart, causing the effusion of a
serous fluid. It occurs as a primary affection and as a
complication in Influenza, Rheumatism and other constitutional
diseases.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—When met with in an idiopathic form, which
is very rare, it may depend upon exposure to damp, cold,
changes of temperature, and those unhealthy conditions
which also cause acute diseases of the respiratory organs.
It may also arise from a sudden change from low, to rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>heating food, or from the field to a hot stable. But it
usually occurs as an accompaniment of Pleurisy or
Rheumatism.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The horse stands quiet, showing signs of
pain and anguish, with sunken head, anxious expression
in the face, dilated nostrils, frequent (100 to 120), wiry,
and sometimes <span class='fss'>IRREGULAR</span> or intermittent <span class='fss'>PULSE</span>, and
general intense fever.</p>

<p class='c004'>The breathing is also accelerated (36) and difficult, and
is accompanied by a movement of the flank similar to that
seen in broken wind, and by a deep depression along the
margin of the costal cartilages. In the early stages, pressure
on the left side, and smart percussion in the region
of the heart, cause flinching and expression of pain; and
auscultation, <i>before exudation has taken place</i>, reveals friction—<i>to
and fro</i>—sounds. These sounds are, however, not
uniformly present in this disorder, nor is their presence an
unquestionable proof of its existence, for similar sounds
may be do to pleural disease, the latter being characterized
by synchronism with the respiratory movements. The
friction sounds are therefore of little value, except as concurrent
with other symptoms. They also cease when
exudation or adhesion has taken place; then the heart’s
beats are muffled. In the later stages, the heart, which
at first palpitates, soon becomes fluttering and uncertain
in its beat, conveying a peculiar pulsation to the hand,
not easily to be described. No impulse can be felt when
the effusion is considerable. Percussion gives a dull sound
over the region of the heart, but not so in other parts of
the chest, where the respiratory and bronchial sounds may
be heard, thus distinguishing Hydrops Percardii from
Hydrothorax. The breathing gradually becomes more
distressing, and movement aggravates the distress; the
pulse more feeble and even imperceptible at the jaw; the
ears and legs cold; the legs, sheath, chest, abdomen, etc.,
œdematous; and the general wasting rapid till death
ensues.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis.</span>—The friction sounds, and pain on percussion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>in the region of the heart, with irregularity in its beats,
and a peculiarly anxious expression of countenance, are
the principal pathognomic symptoms—to which Delafond
adds dyspnœa, attended by an action of the flank like that
of a broken winded horse. The great difficulty is to distinguish
this disease from Pleurisy, which may be done by
accurately marking the period at which the frictional
sounds occur, viz.: during the systole or beat of the
heart, whereas for Pleuritis we hear it during the respiratory
movements of the lungs. When the pericardial
fluid becomes much increased, the friction sound ceases,
as does also the impulse of the heart, which at first
usually palpitates, then becomes fluttering, feeble, and
intermittent, and at last can with difficulty be heard.
Percussion gives a dull sound in the region of the heart,
but just behind it, as well as in other parts of the lungs;
if there is no disease in them, or Hydrothorax, the
resonance in those parts will serve to distinguish Hydrops
Pericardii from Hydrothorax.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prognosis.</span>—In the strong, and in the majority of cases,
favorable.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A.A., given every three hours, and later,
four times per day, will be proper.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Endocarditis</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Inflammation of the fibro-serous membrane
which lines the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a very common complication in Rheumatism,
and is very acute and dangerous; the danger arising less
from the fatality of the acute stage, than from the lesions
which are consequent upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In Endocarditis the contractions of the
heart are energetic, vibratory, and often irregular; the
pulse is also irregular, and frequently intermittent,
and there is a contrast between the feebleness of the pulse
and the violence of the heart beats. Leblanc states that
this last symptom is characteristic of Endocarditis. He
has also observed a loud metallic tinkling, and a <i>bruit de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>souffle</i>, or sound like the blowing of a pair of bellows, or
a sawing noise, like bronchial respiration, accompanying
the systole of the heart. In the early stages, the breathing
is not so difficult as in Pericarditis; but if the auriculo-ventricular
valves are thickened, it becomes distressing.
Sometimes the whole of the membrane is thickened; in
other cases the lesion is limited; in others, the abnormal
growth forms a cardiac Polypus, which may grow to an
enormous size. The legs are usually cold.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Pathology.</span>—The endocardium, although a serous membrane,
is mixed with fibrous elastic tissue at its valvular
reduplications, which accounts for the disease being so
frequently associated with rheumatism, and for the morbid
appearances more commonly witnessed in the valvular
structure of the heart than elsewhere. The natural result
of inflammation in this, as in other serous membranes, is
the effusion of lymph, and consequent thickening, which
sometimes interferes with the play of the valves, or
narrows the auriculo-ventricular openings, thus producing
the bellows-sound which has been described as one of the
chief symptoms. The inflammation may extend to the
muscular substance of the heart, which becomes darkened
in color and easily broken down; while in some cases
large quantities of fibrin are thrown out, which quite
block up the auriculo-ventricular openings and orifices of
the large blood-vessels. To Endocarditis may also be traced
Tumors and Polypi, as well as Hypertrophy and Dilatation.
Abscess in the walls of the heart has also been observed
as a consequence of Endocarditis.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis.</span>—The pathognomic symptoms of Endocarditis
are frequently very obscure, being like those of Pericarditis;
but it is of very little consequence, as the treatment must
be similar. However, the bellows-sound in the former,
and the friction sound in the latter, are sufficient in the
majority of cases to point out the nature of the disease
when taken in connection with other symptoms which
have been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prognosis.</span>—Owing to the various terminations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Endocarditis, nearly all of a serious character, our opinion
as to the ultimate result must be unfavorable, although in
the majority of cases the animal appears to recover; but
he is found afterwards not as good in his wind as formerly,
easily distressed, and when going at an ordinary pace
with hounds, will probably fall down and expire suddenly.
A.A. will be our best resource.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hypertrophy—Enlargement of the Heart</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—An abnormal growth of the muscular
tissue of the heart by thickening of the walls.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Varieties.</span>—There are three. Simple Hypertrophy is
the thickening of the walls without any change in the
capacity of the cavities. Eccentric Hypertrophy is the
thickening of the walls with dilatation of the cavities.
Concentric Hypertrophy is the thickening of the walls
with diminution of the cavities. The lesion is usually
associated with other diseases, and especially with
affections of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disorder is slow in its progress, though it soon
interferes with the working capacity of the animal. It
predisposes to other lesions, such as congestion of the
lungs, hemorrhage, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Excessive effort of the heart to overcome obstruction
to its action; constriction of the vessels and of
the openings between the different cavities of the heart;
deposits on the semi lunar valves; Aneurism of the aorta
or the pulmonary artery; excessive physical exertion and
consequent exhaustion of the heart. Mr. Pritchard remarks
that “horses, particularly those employed in quick
draught, are commonly called on to perform arduous tasks
with full stomachs, by which the free action of the lungs
is considerably impeded; thus, obstruction being given to
the circulation through the pulmonary vessels, corresponding
increase of force in the action of the heart is the
consequence.” Hypertrophy has been often observed in
broken winded horses.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Strong, impulsive movement of the heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>which remains constant; intensity of sound, with a loud,
hollow thumping beat; a metallic <i>bruit</i> or “clack”; irregularity
of rhythm; dullness on percussion. The horse is easily
distressed, palpitation comes on with ordinary quick work,
and there is an anxious expression in his eye on these
occasions, which leads us to suspect that there is something
amiss with the animal. These symptoms are attended with
languor, coldness of legs and ears, dyspnœa, giddiness or
Megrims, loss of appetite, and, in a later stage of the
disease, with œdematous swelling of the chest, abdomen,
and extremities.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Pathology.</span>—The thickening of the walls of the heart
may be regarded as a beautiful provision of nature to
strengthen the organ and enable it to overcome the obstacle
which exists to the free circulation of blood through it.
The thickening of the muscle depends upon excess of
nutrition consequent on increased action; similar to the
change in the biceps muscle of the blacksmith’s arm from
hard work.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may be an idiopathic disease not dependent on
obstruction; but such cases are very rare. The obstruction
will usually be found to depend on disease of some of the
valves, or constriction of the aorta or pulmonary artery at
its origin. The Hypertrophy may be general, or we may
find only one auricle or ventricle (generally the latter)
whose walls are thickened.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis.</span>—The increased impulse of the heart, especially
after quick work; the irregularity of the pulse and
thick wind, without any lung disease being present; and
the dullness on percussion over the cardiac region, are the
chief pathognomic symptoms.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prognosis.</span>—Although the disease is incurable, a horse
may live for years with enlarged heart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Doses of A.A. will be of value in conjunction
with only moderate work and good care.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Atrophy of the Heart</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Emaciation or wasting away of the walls
of the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Similar to those of dilatation. Loss of nervous
power through the degenerating influence of fevers
induces Atrophy by weakening the muscular fibres of
the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Feeble impulse of the heart, with louder
sounds than are usually heard on applying the ear to the
chest. The pulse is generally slow, feeble and intermittent.
The veins in the neck may also be observed to
pulsate. The animal is dull and fastidious in his
appetite; dropsical swellings appear on the chest and
belly; the legs become cold or œdematous. There is
difficulty in breathing on the slightest exertion, and
sometimes palpitation or fluttering of the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Pathology.</span>—There are two forms of Atrophy, one in
which there is a wasted and flabby appearance of the
organ, whose parietes are so weak that when removed
from the body it does not retain the rounded symmetry
of a natural heart, but becomes a shapeless mass when
thrown on the ground. This form of Atrophy was frequently
met with during the prevalence of the Cattle
Plague, and it has been observed in connection with
some forms of Influenza. The second form of Atrophy is
termed Fatty Degeneration of the heart. Of this there
are two varieties. In one the fat grows on the surface of
the organ, encroaching on and insinuating itself between
the muscular fibres, impoverishing them, and ultimately
causing them to waste; the result is that the muscular
walls become thin. In the other variety, fat in a molecular
form takes the place of the muscular element, and
ultimately fills the sheaths, which previously contained
muscular fibre.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dilatation of the Heart</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Enlargement of one or more of the
cavities of the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Some defect in the valvular apparatus, allowing
the blood to regurgitate and to distend the cavity,
which, by pressure on the walls, causes absorption and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>attenuation; loss of power in the nervous system; fevers
of a sthenic or typhoid character, which weaken the
muscular fibres.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The action of the heart is feeble and tremulous;
the pulse small, soft and weak; the least exertion
brings on Dyspnœa; there are languor, giddiness, or
“Megrims”; the horse is “off his food”; the ears and
legs are cold; and ultimately there is œdema of the legs,
belly and chest.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Pathology.</span>—Dilatation may exist either with Hypertrophy
or with Atrophy of the walls of the heart, and in
the latter case is most probably an effect of the emaciated
state of the muscular substance of the heart, which
allows the blood to accumulate, and to distend one or
more of the auricles or ventricles.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Dilatation and atrophy of the heart admit
of very little help in the majority of cases, moderate
work and occasional or daily use of A.A., will be proper,
and do something towards improving the condition and
prolonging the usefulness of the animal.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Palpitation</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—An abnormal increase in the action of
the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Irregularity in the action of the heart is a functional
derangement, and not do to organic disease. It occurs
in horses that are in feeble health and out of condition,
or that have been subject to severe and straining exercise,
such as pulling a heavy load uphill or running hard
with the hounds.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Anemic Palpitation</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—Poverty of blood.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—A dull, thumping sound is heard to proceed
from the cavity of the chest, which, in extreme
cases, may be heard on both sides, and may even be
audible at a distance of some yards, corresponding to the
beatings of the heart and pulse; tumultuous breathing,
redness of the mucous membranes, increased temperature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of the body. Auscultation will detect blood sounds in
the neighborhood of the heart, large arteries, and veins.
These “anemic murmurs” vary with the condition of the
blood, and are caused by its “churning” as it passes
through the traversing channels of the heart. They
constitute a continuous hum, or the “<i>bruit de diable</i>” of
the French. In some cases the action of the heart is so
great that it causes shaking or jerking of the whole body.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prognosis.</span>—When the palpitation does not proceed
from any organic disease, we may expect to remove it in
a very short time by appropriate homeopathic remedies.
A dose of A.A. often relieves an attack.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Spasm of the Diaphragm</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There is a form of palpitation which has received this
designation, and has been mistaken for a functional disorder
of the diaphragm, or excessive motion of the
abdominal muscles. True Spasm of the Diaphragm is
Hiccough; and in this condition there are no such sounds
as characterize Palpitation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—The excessive action of the heart, when the
horse has been distressed by severe gallops or an exciting
run, produces a jerking of the whole body, as the heart
strikes the dorso-costal region, towards the upper part of
the first false ribs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—These are much the same as in Anemic
Palpitation; but in addition there is violent elevation of
the flanks, perceptible to the observer, and, if being
ridden, most unpleasant to the rider. The symptoms
appear and disappear suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A.A. once in two hours, at first,
and later three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Embolism</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Distension and plugging of the arteries by
solid coagulated lymph, consisting of fibrous clots, fragments
of decaying or suppurating tissue, and the elements
of Tubercule and Cancer.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—The reason why there is deposition of the
offending material is unexplained; but it is brought from
different parts of the circulatory system, from diseased
tissues through the veins and the heart, and deposited so
as to obstruct larger or smaller arteries, and thus prevent
the flow of arterial blood to the limbs and organs. The
arteries and hind limbs are most liable to this disorder.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—An accurate diagnosis is not always practicable,
because the disease itself is obscure. The symptoms
which have been observed attending Embolism are
great pain, profuse sweat, but cold extremities; quick,
wiry pulse; and considerable general disturbance of
health; anxious expression of face; looking round to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>affected parts; rigidity and contraction of certain muscles;
partial recovery and simultaneous attack of the other
limb, and return of attack to the first; diminished pulse
in the arteries of the implicated limb; peculiar throbbing
of the posterior aorta felt through the rectum; followed
by partial or complete paralysis of the limb or hind
quarters; and ultimately death.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Aneurism</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—A tumor formed by the dilatation of an
artery, or communicating with an artery, and containing
blood. In the first stage the tumor contains fluid blood,
and pulsates; in its second stage it contains coagulated
blood, deposited in numerous thin layers, resembling the
leaves of a book.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aneurism may be idiopathic or traumatic; the latter is
caused by injury to the artery. In the idiopathic or
spontaneous Aneurism the dilatation may be of considerable
extent, or it may be limited, with the coats of the
artery intact or even thickened, or the inner coat may be
attenuated and the outer one pressed outward. As the
Aneurism becomes old, the coats become indurated,
calcified and liable to burst. It is not an uncommon
disorder in the horse, and when it occurs it is generally
in the deep-seated arteries. The posterior aorta, at the
origin of the anterior mesenteric artery, is very subject to
Aneurism as animals grow older.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis.</span>—This is extremely difficult, for the attendant
symptoms may be readily attributed to some other
malady. They often come on suddenly; the horse
becomes dejected, thin, and unable to work; respiration
is accelerated; pulse and heart beats are irregular; there
is some stiffness in turning, or tenderness on pressure
applied to the loins; swelling and cramps in the hind
legs; Paralysis.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Varicose Veins</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—A morbid dilatation of the veins, causing
a knotty, unequal swelling, so that their valves, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>cannot undergo a corresponding enlargement, cease to be
efficient. The effect is a retarded and imperfect flow of
blood on the return to the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disease occurs most frequently in the form of a
soft, elastic tumor in the saphena vein, where it passes
over the inner surface of the hock joint; but it may affect
another vein, or many veins. It is commonly found
where the blood has been repeatedly drawn.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Violent efforts in drawing; strains; inflammation
set up by a prick in shoeing; frequent bloodlettings.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The affected veins are dilated, tortuous,
knotted, and divided into separate pouches, with obliteration
of the valves. Varix of the saphena at the hock
joint is attended with a tumor, which gradually increases
in size, is flaccid to the touch, slightly pendulous, and
shaking loosely when the horse walks; becoming full and
tense on pressure of the vein above it; and capable of
evacuation by pressure from below upward.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Occasional doses of A.A., are beneficial.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Apoplexy</h4>

<p class='c010'>Occasionally, in consequence of high feeding and deficient
exercise, and especially in fat young horses, with
short necks and large blood-vessels, this disease occurs.
It may also come on in consequence of drawing a heavy
load up a hill. It is predisposed by an overloaded stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In apoplexy, the horse either suddenly
falls down lifeless, or there are premonitory symptoms,
such as vertigo, the animal holds his head down, or leans
it upon something, yawns, perspires slightly, and moves
clumsily, etc. Afterwards, the animal falls down suddenly,
the circulation becomes disturbed and irregular, eyes red,
protruded, and staring; breathing labored, short, rattling;
body covered with sweat, and eyelids paralyzed. After a
few convulsions the animal dies; or, in rare cases, an
improvement takes place, to be again, after a longer or
shorter period of time, followed by relapse, or to result in
paralysis. (Compare the symptoms with those of Epilepsy).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—So soon as any of the premonitory symptoms
are observed, give fifteen drops of A.A. at once,
and repeat the dose every one, two or three hours, until
the animal is relieved, and then at longer intervals. If the
horse falls under an attack of the disease, give of the
above Remedy at once, and repeat the dose every half hour
or hour; remove the harness, etc., and from time to time
pour some cold water upon the head, not too much or
too violently, while you also give the medicine internally.
Injections of salt and water also may be of decided
advantage.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Epilepsy</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease sometimes appears in the horse, and manifests
itself in the following manner: the animal suddenly
trembles, remains standing for an instant with legs spread
out, staggers, and then falls; convulsions ensue; he kicks,
rolls, and twists himself about, grinds his teeth, passes
his dung and urine involuntarily, froths at the mouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the motions of the eye are spasmodic, irregular, and the
respiration loud, painful and sobbing. After a while he
becomes quiet, breathing regular, and he gradually comes
to himself as if coming out of a dream. The duration of
a fit varies from a few minutes to a half hour. The
attacks return again at periods varying from a few days
to several weeks or months, generally coming at shorter
intervals. Epilepsy differs from apoplexy as spasm differs
from paralysis, and a little attention will not fail to
distinguish them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The causes are deep-seated changes in the nervous
organism, and they are rarely curable.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give, on any premonitions of an attack,
fifteen drops of A.A. at once, and you will usually
ward it off. For an attack, put a few drops in the mouth
as soon as you can safely do it, and repeat it every half hour
or hour, until the paroxysm is ended. Afterwards,
always give one dose to prevent a return.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Vertigo, Megrims, Blind Staggers</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is rather a frequent affection of the horse, and is
a consequence of an undue pressure or rush of blood to
the head, in most cases also excited by indigestion or
over-fullness of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the milder cases, the horse stops suddenly, shakes
his head or even staggers in evident giddiness and half-unconsciousness
for a moment, and then goes on again as
if nothing had happened. In more severe cases, he stops
suddenly, shakes his head, falls or drops down, or after
a few unconscious turns and a violent struggle, will
become insensible, and then rise up and go on again; such
attacks closely simulate true epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In all similar cases, whether incipient or
fully developed, give fifteen drops of A.A., and repeat it
every quarter or half hour, until the animal is relieved,
or for twelve or twenty-four hours, and then at intervals
of say four hours, alternate it with J.K., until restored.
When this dozing, stupid condition mentioned above is
present, indicating evident congestion to the head, fifteen
drops of A.A., each morning and noon, and the same of
J.K., at night, will soon restore the animal again.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Paralysis</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Paralysis, entire or partial loss of nervous power over
the muscles of certain parts or portions of the body,
occasionally occurs in the horse as a consequence of
mechanical injuries, severe cold, or some internal cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>When occurring in the face, the muscles of one side lose
the power of motion; the lips hang down, and seem
swollen, are drawn to one side, or pulled upward; food is
picked up and retained with difficulty, mastication is
imperfect, and food drops readily from the mouth.
Sometimes there is no feeling in the face or lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the hinder part of the body is paralized, the
horse is unable to rise or stand, sits on his haunches like
a dog, constipation and arrest of urination are apt to be
present. In slighter cases, the hind legs sway about clumsily
or he drags them after him, or even walks on his fetlocks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The first course in case of recent paralysis,
is to give fifteen drops of A.A., every two hours, which
continue one day; then give fifteen drops of J.K., every
four or six hours, according to the circumstances, until
relieved, and then morning and night for a time.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Brain, Phrenitis. Mad Staggers.</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is most frequently met with in entire horses,
and attacks especially those that are ardent, in high condition,
but little worked; and it is liable to be excited by a
chill after being over-heated or over-worked in hot weather.
It may also arise from blows or similar injuries on the head.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In some cases it comes on slowly; the horse
is dull and sleepy; rests his head on the manger, or
places it against the wall or between his legs, and falls
asleep. In this state he will, perhaps, stagger and almost
fall to the ground; he, however, wakes up, stares about
him, takes a mouthful of hay, chews it slowly, and ere
long is again dozing or fast asleep. The eyelids are
nearly closed; the eyes and nose red; the pupils dilated;
the bowels bound, and pulse slower than in health. This
is the congestive stage, and may continue until the animal
recovers or dies; but, in general, other symptoms appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to which the name Mad Staggers may be more appropriately
applied. In such cases the pulse rises; the
breathing is quickened; the nose and eyes are very red;
nostrils widened; the eyes have a wild, fierce look; the feet
are stamped, as if in passion; he plunges about the stall,
rears upward, strikes out with his fore-feet, and falls
backward upon the ground, where he lies panting and
covered with sweat; his eyes are thrust forward out of
their sockets, and rattles are heard in the throat.
Towards the end these violent paroxysms are repeated
from time to time, and it is very dangerous to approach
or go near him. At last, he is so weak and prostrate
that he cannot rise, and amidst convulsions, strangling,
foaming at the mouth, sweating, and panting for breath,
the animal dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The treatment will not be difficult, or the
result doubtful, during the congestive stage; but in the
fully developed or phrentic stage, quite so in both respects.
The A.A., is the principal dependence, and a dose of
fifteen drops may be given every two or three hours, at
first, and as the horse improves, the intervals may be somewhat
prolonged. Continue this treatment steadily and
without deviation. During the paroxysms, the medicine
may be given by means of a small glass syringe, or the
Medicator used in a similar manner. After the more
intense symptoms have passed over, some doses of J.K.,
alternately with that of A. A., will be of value, giving one
in the morning and the other at night.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Concussion of the brain</i>, inducing symptoms and a condition
not essentially varying from the above, requires
the same treatment, together with such external applications
as the wound may require.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tetanus, or Lock-Jaw</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is more common in the horse than in other
domestic animals. It consists of a muscular spasm of the
jaw (whence its name), which usually from thence extends
to all the muscles of the body. It always occurs in consequence
of an injury or wound, such as broken knees,
open joints, severe bruises, nicked or docked tail, castration,
wounds of the feet, prick of a nail, or even the
galling of a crupper, through which opening the tetanus
germ enters the body.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The germ of tetanus flourishes without air (anaerobic)
and, outside of the body, lives in soil and manure.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In general it comes on very slowly, but also,
in some cases, with great violence. The muscles of the
neck and jaw are first affected, so that the horse has great
difficulty in swallowing and turning his neck. The muscles
then become quite stiff; the mouth is nearly closed; the
jaws cannot be parted, and little or no food can be taken
into the mouth. By degrees all the muscles become affected
I with the same stiffness and cramp; the eyes are still and
staring, pulled back into their sockets, and squinted outward,
and the haw is thrust forward; the neck can not be
bent and the muscles feel hard and firm, the head can not
be raised or lowered, and is held forward, with the nose
stretched out; the nostrils are expanded; the ears pointed
forward, erect, and fixed; the lips are firmly stretched
across the teeth, which are partly seen; the saliva flows
from the mouth; and the horse looks anxious, and can
scarcely move, the belly is hard and tucked up; the tail
is lifted up and held straight out, anti in constant tremble;
the legs are firmly fixed to the ground, and spread
out from each other; the bowels are bound, and urine
passed with difficulty; the breathing is quickened,
labored and convulsive; the pulse is disturbed easily by
frightening or speaking angrily to the horse, and it
becomes afterward weak and trembling. While the
spasm of the muscles continue, the animal is in constant
pain, although it is less severe at some times than others.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Where a wound or injury has taken place,
and tetanus supervenes, it will be, of course, traced directly
to this, and the wound should at once be treated as recommended
for that particular case. If the discharge has
suddenly stopped, it should be reproduced by mild, warm
applications to the part.</p>

<p class='c004'>To relieve the local injury before mentioned, the bran
poultice is usually best, and should be applied quite warm,
and repeated every two or four hours, or when it gets dry
or cold. Look carefully and see if a nail has been driven
into the quick of the foot or some such injury done, and
always relieve the local injury as far as possible. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>horse should be treated with the greatest possible kindness
and not be handled roughly or unkindly. The groom
must not shout or speak angrily, and too much light must
not be admitted to the stable for the same reason. Everything
must be done in the most kind and quiet manner
possible, as you have here not only a muscular spasm,
but a congested condition of the brain also. Before giving
the medicine, the lips, mouth and tongue, should be
cleaned with a cool, wet cloth or rag, and the saliva or
mucus cleared away. If the tongue or lips are dry, moisten
them freely with cold water before giving the medicine.
Bathe the head and neck freely and the stiffened muscles
along the sides of the neck, from time to time, with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, and it will be well
to inject into the anus a quart of linseed or olive oil to
quicken the movements of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the first indication of any <i>stiffness</i> of the <i>jaws</i>, or
<i>contraction</i> of the <i>eye-brows</i> or any <i>other muscle</i>, which are
usually the earlier symptoms of Lock-jaw, give fifteen
drops of A.A., and repeat the dose every hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the disease has been occasioned by a <i>prick of the foot</i>
or any injury of any <i>tendon</i> or like structure, give B.B.,
in alternation with A.A. In like manner the H.H. may
be indicated and given in alternation with the A.A.,
where the kidneys have been implicated in the cause and
there is <i>scanty</i>, <i>suppressed</i>, or <i>difficult Staling</i> as the result.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Food.</span>—When the jaws are firmly set, no food can be
given, but there are times when the spasms relax, and
the jaws are rather wider apart than at other periods.
Green food and gruel may then be offered to the horse.
When the jaws become more open, he may have bran-tea,
clover-tea, or hay tea, gruel and such similar food.
If the jaws cannot be opened, or he cannot swallow, meal
or oatmeal gruel may be injected, by means of a large
syringe, into the fundament, and life be thus prolonged
and a chance thus given for the <span class='sc'>Remedy</span> to act.</p>

<p class='c004'>Care must be taken to feed sparingly when recovering,
or indigestion and a fatal relapse may be the consequence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Spinal Meningitis</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease has become quite common in late years,
sometimes appearing in isolated cases, but more frequently
prevailing in certain cities or sections of country; and to
such an extent as to warrant the idea of an epizootic
influence. Often a large number of horses in a City, County
or State, are more or less seriously attacked. It is mostly
observed in the Winter and Spring, and is favored by
changeable weather, damp or too close stables. Epizootics
of this disease have also been observed in low-lying sandy
regions, doubtless favored if not caused by hauling heavy
loads over deep sandy roads and being exposed when
heated and sore from such effort to cold drenching rains.
The disease having once been developed from such
conditions readily extends itself without the originating
conditions being present. It is also more common among
mares, from their being over-worked or strained when in
heat.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Earlier Symptoms are</span>: Dullness, indisposition to
move, head hanging low, and evident pain and stiffness
on moving, and especially on being turned around. It
loses intelligence and takes no notice of things going on
around him. There is more or less tenderness and
shrinking on pressure on some portion of the spine or
along the entire spine, from the hips forward, or on each
side over the kidneys. The animal does not stand or
move firmly, but sways from side to side or staggers in
walking, or seems to drag the hind legs after him, or is
easily pushed one side, or even over, or leans against the
stall when standing. Finally the back gives out, and the
horse falls down, or cannot rise; he has no strength in the
hind legs. The pulse at first is not much, or but slightly
increased in frequency or force, but by degrees becomes
more rapid. The urine is often scanty or suppressed, the
dung dry, and the animal has from the first a distressed,
suffering look.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the disease has attained its height, the pulse
becomes quick and the temperature raised, and there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>swelling of the throat and congestion of the lungs, and in
some cases high delirium. Later there is increasing
stiffness, paralysis and death.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disease is frequently fatal in the more severe cases,
in two or three days, but often continues from seven to
ten days, and recoveries are usually quite slow.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A.A. should be given in doses of fifteen
drops at first, every hour; then, after six or eight hours—the
intervals may be every two hours, and as the
animal improves, the intervals between doses may be
prolonged to three hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>If during the disease, <span class='fss'>THE URINE</span>, or staling should
become <i>very scanty</i>, or be passed <i>with difficulty</i>, or <i>with
straining</i>, or <span class='fss'>BE SUPPRESSED</span>, then the H.H., for urinary
or kidney affections, should be given, a dose of fifteen
drops, in alternation with the A.A. That is, give the
A.A., and after two hours, give the H.H., then after two
hours again give the A.A., and so on until the secretion
of water is fully established, when the H.H. may be
discontinued.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>After the more urgent stage of the disease has
passed over</span>, the heat and fever mostly gone, and there
yet remains <span class='fss'>SOME WEAKNESS OR PARTIAL PARALYSIS OF THE
LOINS</span>, indicated by swaying, tottering or shambling gait,
the J.K. should be given at intervals of six hours. It is
the special remedy for partial or complete paralysis, or
for the weakness and debility after sickness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The horse should have a loose box, or wide, roomy
stall, well littered and reasonably warm, and in cool or
cold weather, be well covered with blankets, and his
legs should be occasionally well hand rubbed. Let him
have bran mashes, or carrot tea, and pick at some good
hay. The animal should not be exercised or worked too
soon after recovery.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Chill</h4>

<p class='c010'>This term is used to designate a transitory state or
condition, which may either terminate in recovery, or in
severe inflammatory disease of some important organ or
affection, of which the chill is the first stage. When a
chill is present it is impossible to say, with certainty,
whether or what further derangement will ensue. But it
is quite certain an abnormal condition is already present,
with the probability that it will develop some disease or
inflammation, of which we now have the first or forming
stage. Usually the length and violence of the chill is in
proportion to the importance of the organ attacked, and
the character of the morbid influence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>direct</i> causes of a chill are: exposing the animal to
cold draughts; allowing him to drink freely of cold water,
in very hot or during very cold weather; exhausting him
with labor and then placing him in a damp stable; washing
the legs with cold water, or riding him (while in a
state of perspiration), into a stream of cold water.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The symptoms which are usually observed
before the chili proper sets in, are: dullness or want of
spirit on entering a stable after a journey; hanging of the
head; standing fixedly in one place; taking little or no
notice when spoken to; smelling at the food; picking
amongst it for a short time and then leaving it altogether.
In addition to these, the eye is dull and countenance
dejected; the animal grinds his teeth and breathes quicker
than usual, while the pulse is rarely or never disturbed at
the commencement. Soon the coat will begin to prick
and the animal will begin to tremble with considerable
violence; his breathing will become more hurried, attended
with a harsh blowing sound in the nasal passages; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>pulse still retaining its usual slow beat. Sometimes the
breathing becomes quick, hurried and loud “panting.”
This condition may continue half an hour, or even two
hours or more, when the patient will become more quiet,
the breathing softer, more tranquil, the skin and extremities
warmer, and the pulse rises to fifty or even sixty
beats to the minute. From this condition the attack may,
under judicious treatment, pass off, and speedy recovery
ensue; or, it may pass into a Catarrhal Fever, or Pneumonia,
or Bronchitis, or Lymphitis, or Laminitis, or
Inflammation of the bowels, or what is quite common, a
bad, obstinate cough.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—With as little delay as may be, the patient
should be comfortably housed and blanketed, and fifteen
drops of A.A., should be given. If not better in half an
hour, repeat it, and again at intervals of half an hour,
until the trembling and respiration have been relieved
and the chill has passed off. Then the animal may be
safely left under the influence of the same medicine, to be
repeated every two or three hours, so long as circumstances
seem to require it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should any of the diseases above mentioned, or other,
have become developed, the treatment must be varied to
meet that condition; the particulars of which are to be
sought under the respective sections in this Manual. But
it will most frequently be found that having met and
conquered the enemy at the threshold, but little more
remains to be done beyond care and rest, for the entire
recovery of the animal.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cold, Grippe, Catarrh</h4>

<p class='c010'>The nose and air-passages are lined with a delicate membrane,
whose office it is to secrete a thin mucous which
lubricates the parts. Under the influence of a chill,
suppressed perspiration, etc., this membrane becomes
irritated, inflamed, and the discharge arrested, or it is
thickened, increased, or variously modified.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms usually are, the horse is not so lively as
usual; he eats little or no food; he coughs and sneezes; a
watery discharge flows from one or both nostrils, and also
from the eyes, which are red and swelled.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>In the more severe form, there is a chill, warm skin,
quick pulse, frequent and somewhat difficult breathing,
sore throat, pain in the throat when pinched, frequent
cough, rough coat, bound bowels, red eyes, and red and
I dry nose; tears flow freely, and little or no food is eaten—all
symptoms indicating a catarrhal fever. As the
animal improves, the discharge from the nose becomes
white or yellowish, and more profuse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where numerous horses are attacked about the same
time, the symptoms assume a more severe form, attended
with a greater degree of prostration than in cases of
common cold, and it then merits the name of <span class='sc'>Influenza</span>.
The symptoms of one year vary from those of another,
and during the same season all animals are not handled
alike, though the general outline will be the same. The
attending fever is of a low grade, comes on suddenly, and
soon reaches its height, and lowness of spirits and weakness
are predominant. The symptoms are often as
follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>The horse is dull, low-spirited, and easily tired; he
yawns and hangs his head; his coat stares; sweats easily,
and breathes quickly, when slightly worked or moved.
He eats little or nothing. As the disease advances, the
skin is sometimes hot and again cold; the mouth and
tongue are dry and hot; the white of the eye and nose are
red; the bowels bound; urine scanty; the eyelids swelled,
partly closed, tears flow down the face and fret the skin.
The sides of the nostrils are also fretted by the acrid discharge
from them, which is sometimes very profuse. The
throat may be so inflamed that swallowing is attended
with pain and difficulty—the animal “quids” his food,
and splashes the water with his muzzle, being afraid to
swallow either fluid or solid food. The throat is painful,
hot, and swelled on the outside; the glands are also
swelled, hard and painful, and sometimes come to a head.
The cough is frequent, sometimes coming on in fits, and
breathing is sometimes quite obstructed and difficult.
When the disease has lasted some time, the dung is slimy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and mixed with blood, and the discharge from the nose
is sometimes bloody.</p>

<p class='c004'>A common cold may terminate in inflammation of the
bronchia or lungs, by extending downward, or it may be
cured and expend itself merely in the nose and throat.
So an Influenza may extend and involve the pulmonary
tissue, and is far more grave than is usually supposed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—When the disease commences with a
chill, or any considerable degree of fever is present, give
fifteen drops of A.A., and repeat it several times, at
intervals of one or two hours. Then alternate the Remedy
E.E., with the fever medicine, at intervals of
two or three hours, until the disease is broken up and the
horse is well. In case of Influenza, even with very
threatening symptoms, the E.E., and A.A., should be
given alternately, say every two hours, in doses of fifteen
drops; keeping the animal well covered and in a warm
stable. After all the feverish symptoms have disappeared,
only the E.E., will be required, and the intervals between
the doses may be prolonged as the animal improves. In
case the discharge from the nose is profuse or thick and
excoriating, or when the sore throat is present, or predominates,
C.C., is better than the E.E., and may be
given alone, or better, in alternation with A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the <i>legs become swelled</i>, with <i>scanty urine</i>, H.H.,
should be interposed, either alone or in alternation with
C.C., at the same intervals and doses, and this may be
continued to the conclusion of the case, either alone or
in alternation with the E.E.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Influenza—Pink Eye—Horse Distemper</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is well known among horse dealers, and in
the stables of all our large cities. It is not so often found
in the open country, but cases occur where green or young
horses are taken from pasture and subjected to the closer
atmosphere and changed diet of a warm stable. It is
generally found among green horses who have been
brought from the country to our large cities for sale or
use, and quite, a large proportion of all such horses are
more or less seriously affected by it. The disease is really
a Catarrhal Influenza, whose symptoms are variously
modified and only possibly received the now generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>accepted name of <span class='sc'>Pink Eye</span>, from a frequent appearance
of the eye in the earlier stages of the malady. The supposed
causes have been sufficiently above hinted.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—There is a wide diversity in the symptoms,
but the more common manifestations are as follows: The
horse is first observed to be <i>dumpish</i>, dull and disinclined
to move, or moving clumsily, and looks as if he had been
sick; the vessels of the eye are distended, turgid, the
inner lid and corners being unnaturally red (whence,
probably, the name), the lids become swollen, the animal
shrinks from the light and tears trickle over the eyelid,
and lumps of purulent matter occasionally gum up or fill
the angles. The head seems heavy and hangs down, or
he rests it upon the manger. First one hind leg and then
the other swells and becomes infiltrated with fluid, extending
from the fetlock up and filling the sheath, and
often along under the belly with an immense infiltration
of fluid. This swelling is considered characteristic, comes
on suddenly, affects the whole limb, groin and sheath.
The hair from the first looks unhealthy, and has a rough
feeling; the ears, nose and limbs are cold or wet, according
to the stage of the disease. The appetite is poor from
the first, and an attempt to swallow shows that the throat
is sore; the fauces will be found inflamed, the tongue is
foul, thickly coated, and saliva runs freely, though in
some cases the mouth is dry and feverish; the dung is
voided in small quantities, as all the functions seem
torpid. In some cases the glands of the neck become
involved, tenderness and swelling is found on examination,
and this swelling may soften and terminate in an
abscess under the jaw. There is not unfrequently a
cough. After a few days, a discharge from the nose sets
in, which is considered a favorable crisis.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The patient should have the benefit of a
pure atmosphere—the more elevated, pure and uncontaminated,
the better to arrest blood deterioration—and
be covered according to the temperature of the stable and
season. The limbs may be rubbed and clothed if cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>but not rubbed if they are hot and feverish. In the
febrile stage, the natural covering is sufficient. Fat
horses need but trifling food, and bran mashes, scalded
spout feed, or green food in moderation are best until the
turn of the disease.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give with the first indication of the disease, the A.A.,
which repeat at intervals of three hours, in doses of
fifteen drops. This may be continued one, two or more
days, so long as the pulse is quick, mouth hot, or general
fever, or swelled, reddish eyes. When, however, <i>the
throat</i> is found to be sore, <i>glands</i> under the jaws <i>swelled
or tender</i> on pressure, or there is a discharge from the
nose, the C.C., is more appropriate, and should be substituted
for the A.A., and the same doses given at the
same intervals. If, however, there is yet with the above
fever and heat, the two remedies may be given alternately—first
A.A., then C.C., at intervals of three hours
between the doses.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the <i>legs</i> and <i>sheath</i> have begun to swell, the H.H.,
is in order, and should be given to rouse into activity the
urinary secretion, and so reduce the swelling. Give then
the H.H., every three hours, in alternation with the C.C.,
and so continue until the disease is arrested and the
patient is convalescent. Too great care cannot be exercised
when the legs are swelled, to <i>let the horse stand</i>, not
to move or exercise the patient, as the movement or
exercise while the legs are swelled or hot, invariably
aggravates the difficulty, and may cause it to extend to
the lungs or other important organs. Take the feed
away, or keep the feed very low, no grain, only a bran-mash,
or pick at a little hay, and let the horse stand, and
the swelling will disappear with the use of the medicines
mentioned. If from cold or exposure, or an extension of
the morbid process, the <i>lungs should become involved</i> and
Pneumonia be present, the disease will require to be
treated by the A.A., and E.E., as directed for that
disease, which see.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any weakness, or loss of appetite or condition, remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>as a sequel of the disease, will be removed by the use
of J.K., giving fifteen drops three times a day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cough</h4>

<p class='c010'>Cough is so well known as to require no description.
It is in almost all cases a mere symptom of some disease
or morbid condition of the air passages, such as a cold,
bronchitis, catarrh, or other more serious affection of the
chest, upon the cure of which it disappears. In some
cases, however, this affection is so slight as to occasion
only cough as a symptom of its existence, and the cough
may be said to be idiopathic. Continued cough predisposes
to inflammation, yet some horses have a slight
cough for years without being otherwise unwell. Other
coughs are connected with thick wind, broken wind,
glanders, worms and indigestion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—For chronic coughs fifteen drops of E.E.,
morning and night. In complicated or recent cases, the
Remedy may be given four times per day. Sometimes
the A.A., is more efficient, even when no fever or heat is
apparent. For catarrhal coughs, give C.C., either alone
or in alternation with A.A.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Heaves, Broken Wind, Thick Wind, Whistles</h4>

<p class='c010'>These are merely varieties of nearly one and the same
pathological condition, and the distinctions lead to no
practical result in my method of treatment.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Thick Wind</span> is generally the result of an imperfectly
cured bronchitis or pneumonia, leaving either the mucous
membrane of the bronchia permanently thickened, or
some portions of the lung more or less solidified, thus
impairing its capacity and diminishing or destroying its
elasticity. Hence, the horse when exercised, especially
up hill, breathes short, hurriedly, and more laboriously
than in health. This causes much distress, the horse
expands his nostrils, heaves, pants and breathes with
difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><span class='sc'>Broken Wind</span> is the result of <i>emphysema</i> of the lungs,
that is, the minute air-cells in certain portions of the
lungs become dilated, lose their elasticity or power of
contraction, and breaking one into another, form variously-sized
sacks of air, the entrance to which becomes
closed, so that this air remains resident in the lungs and
so far destroys its use. Spasm of the air-tubes acts in a
similar manner, hence it may come and go, but the former
condition is more or less permanent. Spasm, or disease
of the midriff, is frequently connected with it. The usual
symptoms are: the flanks are slowly drawn up until they
have a tucked up appearance, when they suddenly fall
down. The act of forcing the air <i>from the lungs</i> is far
more difficult, and requires longer time than to <i>inspire</i> or
draw it in. There is also a short, weak, wheezing cough,
rough, dry coat; greediness for food, yet the animal is
thin and looks poor; the belly is swelled with wind; oats
often pass unchanged from the bowels.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Some cases of broken and thick wind cannot
be cured, as they depend upon organic changes in the
structure of the lungs, themselves incurable, yet all can
be benefited by the persistent use of the proper remedies,
and proper attention to food and work.</p>

<p class='c004'>In all cases of this disease, of whatever variety, if recent
or extensive, give fifteen drops of E.E., noon and at
night, and the same of A. A., each morning. In old, long standing
cases, give fifteen drops of the A.A., every
morning, and the same of E.E., at night, continuing the
treatment with perseverance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Food.</span>—As the animal suffers from want of space in the
chest, so the distension of the stomach with an undue
quantity of food tends much to increase the difficulty.
Hence the most condensed form of food is best, plenty of
oats and little hay, but no chaff, straw, or bloating feed,
water in moderate quantities, but never to repletion until
the day’s work is over. Green food, carrots especially,
are always useful. They are readily digested, and are
peculiarly beneficial to the respiratory organs. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>contrary, bloating, flatulent, poor feed, will tend to increase,
and may even occasion, broken wind. The horse
should not be worked soon after a full meal.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bronchitis</h4>

<p class='c010'>From exposure to wet and cold; sudden changes of
weather; turning the horse into a cold, wet place, or
bringing him from grass to a warm stable; standing in a
draft of cold air, or washing the warm, sweating skin and
not drying it afterwards, an inflammation of the bronchial
tubes and minute air-cells takes place, meriting the
name of <span class='sc'>Bronchitis</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease generally begins with a slight
cough, quick breathing, sore throat, low spirits, dislike
of food, slight discharge from the nostrils, pain of the
throat when pinched, and some difficulty of swallowing.
In some cases, it comes on suddenly with shaking; the
legs, ears and muzzle are at one time hot and at another
cold; the skin is rough and staring; the head hung down;
mouth hot; the animal remains standing, and does not
wish to move; pulse is full and quick; the cough short,
frequent, and irritating; the breathing quick and difficult;
the eyes and nose red, and rattles are heard in the
windpipe at the breast. A profuse discharge of matter
from the nostrils indicates the period from which improvement
commences.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of A.A., and E.E.,
alternately every three hours, beginning with A.A. After
a day or two, as the animal improves, the intervals
between the doses may be prolonged to four or six hours.
Keep the animal well covered and protected until recovery
takes place. After the feverish symptoms have disappeared
the E.E., may be relied upon.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Stabling and Food.</span>—In all cases of serious disease of
the lungs or air-passages, the horse should be placed in a
large, roomy stable or stall, into which the fresh air may
freely come, but all damp draughts of air excluded; all
dung, damp and dirty straw carefully removed; spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>clean straw on the floor; blanket him according to the
season, the state of the weather, and skin; hand-rub
and flannel bandage the legs every night and morning,
or oftener if necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>For food, bran mashes, gruel, and tempered water only;
when recovering, malt or bran mashes, boiled oats,
turnips, carrots, and green food, if in season.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Larynx, Laryngitis</h4>

<p class='c010'>The larynx is the upper portion of the windpipe, and
inflammation of it sometimes occurs and is very dangerous.
It is not often unmixed, but is generally accompanied with,
or is an extension of, cold or bronchitis, and its causes are
the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is sometimes a dangerous disease, and may kill by
suffocation or degenerate into bronchitis, or pneumonia.
It is recognized by the difficulty of respiration, <span class='fss'>WHICH IS
LOUD AND HEARD AT A DISTANCE</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The outside of the throat is hot, painful and swelled;
swallowing is sometimes difficult, and the fluid even may
return by the nose; the breathing is short and difficult, and
when the air is drawn into the lungs, a rough, harsh sound
is heard in the larynx; the cough, at first short and hard,
becomes more hoarse and feeble, and occurs in fits,
especially during an attempt to swallow; the pulse is quick,
hard and full, and skin hot. As the disease advances the
breathing becomes more difficult, and is attended with a
rasping, crowing sound, the neck is straightened and held
stiffly, the head raised and larynx drawn towards the
breast, the nostrils are widened, the nose lead colored,
the eyes red, skin damp with sweat, the pulse becomes
weak and irregular, and at last from the increasing
narrowness of the windpipe, the horse actually dies for
want of breath.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The treatment is by no means difficult or
complicated. Give fifteen drops of A.A., every hour,
during the violence of the disease, and until the difficult
breathing has abated and the animal becomes comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>easy. Then the intervals may be prolonged to two
and then to three hours, or more, until entire relief is
obtained. If a cough remains, the E.E. may be given in
alternation, with the A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should the windpipe be very sore to the touch outside,

<h4 class='c009'>Nasal Gleet</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is the term applied to an old, long standing, running
from the nose. It arises from a morbid condition
of the lining membrane of the nose, and is often the result
of a badly treated or neglected cold, especially in old,
worn out horses, and is similar to catarrh in the human
species. Sometimes a diseased tooth in the upper jaw
may give rise to a similar discharge, but this is not a
true gleet. An almost incredible quantity of thickened
mucous of different colors sometimes passes, if the horse
is at grass, almost as green as the food on which he lives;
or if he be stabled, white, straw-colored, brown, or even
bloody, and sometimes evidently mingled with matter or
pus; and either constantly running, or snorted out in
masses many times in the day. Sometimes the discharge
comes only from one nostril, at other times both nostrils
are affected; in some cases the glands under the jaw are
enlarged, in other cases no enlargement can be discovered;
perhaps after the discharge has been very copious for
some time it suddenly stops, and the animal remains free
from any discharge for several weeks, when it comes on
again as bad as ever; generally speaking, exercise increases
the discharge. Horses affected with this disease
have been known to continue free from any discharge for
six or eight weeks, whilst they have continued to rest;
they have been taken to work, and in a day or two the
discharge has returned as bad as before.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The discharge is yellowish or like cream
and in some cases greenish. It may be discharged in
clots, or of some thickness, constantly flowing, or snorted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>out in quantities; it may come from both nostrils, but
generally only from the left. The glands under the left
jaw are often fixed, hard, and painful. The membrane
of the nose has a lead color. The discharge may stop for
a time, and then come on again, more profuse than
before. After continuing a long time, the animal becomes
thin and poor, and may finally die.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of C.C., three times
per day. It will be found quite sufficient to entirely
control and finally arrest it in recent cases, and will not
fail to benefit even the most inveterate.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pleurisy, Pneumonia, Inflammation of the Chest</h4>

<p class='c010'>The pleura is the delicate serous membrane, covering
the lungs with one surface, and lining the cavity of the
chest with the other. Systematic writers treat of the
inflammation of this membrane, Pleurisy, and that of the
substance of the lungs, Pneumonia, separately. But as
this rarely occurs in fact, and leads to no practical result
in the treatment, and indeed can be rarely detected before
death, I prefer the more practical course of treating them
together. An inflammation of the lungs rarely or never
remains so, but eventually involves the pleura more or
less, and so an inflammation of the pleura always involves
more or less extensively, the pulmonary substance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Catarrh, Influenza, Cold, or bronchial irritation
may, either of them, terminate in this disease if
neglected, or from fresh exposure. A sudden transition
from heat to cold; change from a warm stable to a colder
one; neglect of the usual blanketing, or even of other
comforts; hard and long riding against a cold wind in
snowy weather; loitering in an exposed, bleak place, when
the horse is fatigued and warm, without covering. It
sometimes occurs when horses are suddenly turned out to
grass, or when they have been taken up and turned into
a very warm stable. Injuries, contusion, rupture, or great
violence done to the chest, is quite sure to be followed by
Pleurisy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—For conveniences sake, we will indicate the
symptoms of these two branches of the disease separately.
Pleurisy invariably commences with shaking all over,
followed by a hot, dry mouth, white coated tongue, red
nose and eyes, low spirits, want of appetite, anxious look,
and hard, quick, wiry pulse. The act of drawing the air
<i>into the lungs</i> is short, and stops, or is cut off at a certain
point, at which time the pain is felt; the act of forcing
the air <i>from the lungs</i> is full and slow. The pain is increased
by coughing and taking full breath which the
horse will do if suddenly moved or frightened. If the
inflamed side is pressed upon, he gives forth a sound like
a grunt; the cough is short; the horse remains standing;
the skin on the inflamed side is thrown into folds, and
twitches are occasionally seen at the same place. The
painfulness of the spaces between the ribs when pressed
upon, is quite characteristic, and often exists to an intense
degree. The horse shrinks from it with a low grunt, and
tries to get away. The skin about the sides of the nostrils
and at the ends of the mouth is wrinkled. The neck is
lengthened, and nose thrust forward; the horse stands in
a crouching manner, and seems uneasy, but does not
move. As the disease advances, the pulse becomes more
frequent, and afterwards smaller, until it can scarcely be
felt; the breathing becomes quicker and more painful
and catching, when the air is drawn into the lungs. Then
by degrees, no catch is seen or grunt heard, the twitches
are not observed, cold, clammy sweats break out over the
body, the horse appears dull and stupid, and death closes
the scene.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pleura, like all serous membranes, has a strong
tendency to effusion, or exudation of fluid, during an
inflammatory action, and in the course of the disease,
this effusion, consisting of yellowish serum, is exuded, in
quantities varying from a few ounces to a bucket full. It
occurs in all severe cases, and the fluid either is again
absorbed, if in small quantity, or is the immediate cause
of death, if in very large quantity, or a lesser amount may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>remain for a long time, impeding respiration, and forming
an empyema or dropsy of the chest. When it exists, the
breathing is always labored, and there is <i>œdema</i> or tumid
swelling of some external part, generally the abdomen,
chest, or point of the breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>By listening with the ear against the chest, the progress
of the effusion may be traced from below upward. Above
it will be heard the loud crackling respiration and grating
peculiar to the disease; below, the dullness and stillness
of the lung enveloped in fluid, the absence of sound, marks
the line of the accumulated fluid, its increase and diminution.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>In Pneumonia</span>, the symptoms differ from Pleurisy, yet
the difference manifests itself in this, that in <i>Pleurisy</i> there
is more pain, and in <i>Pneumonia</i> more difficult breathing.
Pneumonia is often a consequence of a cold, bronchitis,
or the termination of some disease of the air-passages, and
may begin with symptoms of a cold—rough coat, want of
appetite, low spirits, etc. In other cases, it begins with a
shivering chill; the legs, ears and skin are cold; the coat
is rough; the nose pale and dry; quick pulse, which
afterwards becomes frequent and full; breathing at first
quick, then panting and heaving; the skin now becomes
hot, except <i>the legs, which remain very cold</i>. This is a
<i>characteristic symptom and will never deceive</i>; the nose and
eyes are red; mouth hot and dry; the eyes have a yellowish
color, and the horse looks uneasy and restless.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the disease extends, the breathing becomes more
difficult, and is attended with heaving of the flanks; the
nostrils are much widened; the nose and head held out;
the neck lengthened; the forelegs are fixed in one place,
and spread apart; the nose and eyes have a dark blueish
color; the face looks anxious and disturbed; <i>the legs</i> and
ears are <i>very cold</i>; the legs seem fine, and the hair upon
them glossy; the cough is more frequent, hard and painful;
the horse seems drowsy; there is no appetite; the
dung is hard and covered with slime, and the urine high-colored
and scanty.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>In the last stage, the pulse is small, weak, and can
scarcely be felt, the breathing is quicker and more difficult;
the breath is very hot; the eyes and nose are lead colored;
the skin is cold, and clammy sweat breaks out
upon it here and there; the mouth is cold; the tongue is
coated; the teeth are ground every now and then, and
twitches are occasionally seen. The eyes become more
and more heavy, glassy and dim; the strength becomes
less and less; the horse leans against the stall or manger,
or wanders around; he staggers and falls; tries to rise,
but cannot; groans, struggles and dies.</p>

<p class='c004'>As an improvement takes place, the horse appears more
natural, warmth returns to his extremities, his breathing
is more free, pulse softer, fuller and less frequent, cough
easier, <i>and he lies down</i> quietly, and without uneasiness.
These good symptoms rarely or never deceive.</p>

<p class='c004'>Placing the ear against the ribs, upon various parts of
the chest, we may learn with some practice to distinguish
the progress of inflammation. In the healthy lung, the
air passes in with a slight, rustling murmur, quite
characteristic, and which, once heard, will always be
recognized. As the lung becomes inflamed, “crepitation”
takes place and we hear a sound, slightly cracking, like
that made by salt thrown into the fire, or by rubbing the
hair between the fingers close to the ear. As by degrees
the lung becomes more intensely inflamed, it is more and
more impervious to the air, until it becomes “hepatized”
or solid, and gives no sound, and no resonance when
percussed, or struck upon. These changes are interesting,
and afford to the practised ear clear indications of the
state and progress of the disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of A.A., every two
hours, for the first twenty-four hours. After that, give
the E.E., alternately with the A.A., at intervals of two
or three hours between the doses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Continue this treatment steadily and uniformly by night
as well as by day, if the attack is severe, giving no other
medicine, and making no deviation. After a day or two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>with the remission of the more violent symptoms, the A.A.
may be omitted entirely, and only the E.E. given, as also
after the disease has turned, and during convalescence.
After the horse has commenced to improve, a dose of E.E.,
every four hours during the day, will be sufficient. The
treatment is the same whether symptoms of Pleurisy or
Pneumonia predominate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stabling and food as under Bronchitis.</p>

<p class='c004'>We should bear in mind that in all severe cases of this
disease, resolution does not take place under four days,
and if an improvement takes place in one, two or three
days, we should be satisfied. Rare indeed will be the
cases that do not terminate favorably under Humphreys’
Homeopathic practice, carefully applied.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Dentition or Difficult Teething</h4>

<p class='c010'>The cutting or shedding of the teeth, and especially of
the tushes, is sometimes attended with considerable disorder
of the body. The animal either will not eat his food,
or he has pain and difficulty in chewing it; the body grows
thin; bowels are out of order; humors may break out in
the skin, and there may be cough and slight fever present.
The gum is hot, painful and swelled.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of A.A., three times per
day. This soon relieves the feverish irritation, and the
tooth usually makes its way quietly to the surface.
Nicking the gum directly over the tooth in the form of a
cross is sometimes beneficial. If teeth are very slow in
coming, showing an evident deficiency of bony deposit,
an oyster shell burned to lime, and broken or ground in
his feed, will promote the growth and production of bone,
and be of service.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diseased or Irregular Teeth</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes the teeth of a horse present irregularities.
Some of the teeth are too long, or become ragged. As a
consequence, the tongue or cheeks are wounded, and the
horse eats imperfectly, has pain, drops or “quids” his
food. Whenever this condition is found, if the difficulty
does not mend itself, the long teeth should be extracted
if loose, or be filed down, and the points of the ragged
teeth smoothed off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Decayed teeth produce similar symptoms. In addition,
a bad smell exudes from the mouth; stringy saliva flows
away in large quantities, and the eyes may be inflamed.
If allowed to remain, the fang may become diseased, the
socket and gum inflame, an abscess form, and a portion
of the jaw-bone may die. If in the upper jaw, the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>may burst into the nose and be discharged. It is of bad
smell and color, and has been mistaken for nasal gleet
and glanders.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Examine carefully with the finger</i>, and by feeling along
the jaw, see if there is any swelling or indentation, or if
there is any old stub or loosened tooth, a milk tooth that
has been pushed one side, or down, or is loose, making
the gum inflamed or painful and preventing the animal
from properly eating his food. If so, remove the stub or
loose tooth, or file off the ragged portion, so that the
mouth may become sound and healthy. Sometimes a
thick, unhealthy discharge from the nostrils has been
mistaken for glanders, when the real difficulty was from
diseased teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Draw out the diseased tooth, and give
fifteen drops of A.A., each morning, and the same dose
of C.C., at night, for several days.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Lampas</h4>

<p class='c010'>Occasionally the bars of the mouth swell and rise to a
level with, and even beyond, the teeth, occasioning soreness,
pain, and difficulty of eating. It is most common
in young horses, in connection with the cutting and
shedding of teeth, from congestion and the extension of
the inflammation of the gums during this process. It also
occurs in old horses; for the growth of teeth in horses
continues during life. Derangement of stomach, or
worms, is sometimes connected with it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of A.A., two or three
times per day. This will soon relieve the irritation and
swelling. Should there be any derangement of the digestive
organs, a few doses of J.K., given morning and night, will
promptly relieve not only the derangement of the stomach,
but the Lampas also.</p>

<p class='c004'>Swelling or soreness of the gums will be promptly
relieved by giving fifteen drops of J.K., daily, or even,
morning and night.</p>

<p class='c004'>The searing of the bars with a hot iron, as is sometimes
practiced by cruel and ignorant smith’s, cannot be too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>strongly condemned. It tortures the horse to no purpose,
renders the mouth callous, and destroys the delicacy and
sensibility of a part upon which all the pleasure of driving
and riding consists, while it is totally unnecessary.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Crib-Biting</h4>

<p class='c010'>Much has been written about crib-biting or wind sucking.
It has sometimes been regarded as a vicious habit
and at other times as connected with indigestion. However,
there is much better basis for believing it to be a
bad habit than anything else.</p>

<p class='c004'>Horses that are worked regularly every day rarely
develop it; and it is only among horses which are only
used occasionally, and which stand for long hours in the
stall, that we find it. Also in a stable of the latter kind
if one horse starts it the others soon follow his example.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Many things have been tried, but the
best results have been obtained by giving the horse
plenty of regular work. If there is any disturbance of
the digestive organs which has been occasioned by the
wind sucking J.K. would be the proper remedy.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Loss of Appetite</h4>

<p class='c010'>Loss of appetite, or diminished appetite, is but a mere
symptom of some more general affection. It is a symptom
of almost every disease, and especially of every morbid
condition of the digestive organs. There are cases, however,
in which this seems the most prominent symptom;
and the animal appears well in every other respect, save
that he does not eat. The teeth should be examined, and,
if needful, corrected. We should see also if the throat is
sore. In general, loss of appetite will be found connected
with a morbid or unhealthy condition of the digestive
organs, and will yield to a few doses of J.K., fifteen drops,
morning and night. This is also the appropriate remedy
for defective appetite or the weakness which often remains
after acute disease.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Ill Condition, Indigestion</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In consequence of over-feeding, bad food, suddenly
changing the kind of food, working the horse too soon
after eating too much food, or bad and uneven teeth,
which prevent the horse from chewing his food well, the
following condition presents itself:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The skin has the condition known as hidebound;
the horse sweats easily; he is weak, and cannot
work so long or with so much spirit as in health; he is
thin and does not fatten; his tongue is foul; mouth
slimy; the dung is dry, mixed with undigested oats, or it
is slimy or bad smelling; the water is variable, scanty
and thick, or clear and abundant, and there is a short,
frequent cough. Sometimes he eats very greedily, and at
others will eat nothing placed before him, or will take
one kind of food and leave another, or he likes dirty straw
or his bedding better than the best oats or hay, or, in
some instances, his morbid appetite leads him to lick the
wall or eat plaster from it.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is sometimes accompanied by dullness or dizziness
(stomach staggers).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Correct the feeding. Give not too much,
and only that most acceptable at first. Give J.K., three
times per day for a week, then J.K. morning and noon,
and I.I., at night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Colic</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is one of the most common diseases of the horse.
The passage of food along the bowels is effected by the
alternate contraction and relaxation of the muscular coat
of the intestines. Hence it is easy to perceive that flatulent
or irritating food, food in too large quantities, large
quantities of green food that produce much gas, masses
of hard, dry dung, or sudden chill upon the warm skin,
all may produce irregular contraction of the intestines,
and hence produce pain and colic. Tumors, worms and
stones also produce the same result.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In colic the attack begins suddenly. The
animal is uneasy; shifts his position, paws or stamps the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>ground, kicks his belly with his hind feet, looks frequently
at his flanks, groans, falls upon the ground and rolls
about violently, or lies on his back, in which posture he
remains for a short time, seeming quiet and free from
pain. Soon, however, the pain comes on again, even
with symptoms of greater intensity than before. He
throws himself widely about, careless of the injuries he
receives during these moments of agony and tossing. He
grinds his teeth, bites the manger, and looks towards his
flanks with a wild, anxious expression. If he improves,
the paroxysms become less frequent and less violent, and
free intervals longer, until entire relief; or if worse, the
pain becomes more and more intense, paroxysms more
frequent, until there is no free intervals; inflammation
results, the ears and legs become cold, pulse small and
wiry, and the animal dies from the results of the inflammation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many of the symptoms of colic are similar to those of
inflammation of the bowels, and as the latter is by far
the most formidable disease, we will endeavor to distinguish
them, so as to avoid mistake.</p>

<p class='c004'>The attack of colic is sudden, while that of inflammation
is more gradual. In colic, the pulse is rarely
quickened, and never so early in the disease, while in
inflammation it is very quick and small even from the
first.</p>

<p class='c004'>In colic, the legs and ears are of the natural temperature.
In inflammation, they are cold. In colic, there is
relief from rubbing the bowels, and from motion. In
Inflammation, the bowels are very tender, and motion
vastly augments the pain. In colic, there are intervals
of rest, while in inflammation there is constant pain. In
colic, the strength is scarcely affected, while in inflammation
there is great and rapidly increasing weakness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Attention to these peculiarities will enable one to
distinguish between the two diseases, and to avoid error
in the treatment.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of F.F., on the tongue,
and repeat the dose every half, or even quarter of an hour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>until relieved, omitting the medicine altogether, or giving
it at longer intervals as soon as the amendment is perceived.
We have in the F.F., a remedy which rarely
fails to arrest this disease.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, at the commencement or during the progress of the
disease, fever and inflammatory symptoms should also
exist, then alternate the A.A., with the F.F., at the
intervals mentioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the attack has clearly been occasioned by an <i>over-feed</i>,
or by bad, heavy, indigestible food, it will be best
to alternate the J.K., with F.F., at the intervals directed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The colic not unfrequently comes from the kidneys,
which may be suspected by the horse making frequent
attempts at staling, or his passing scanty, thick or bloody
urine. In these cases, give fifteen drops of H.H., every
half hour, alone or in alternation, with the A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should there be suspicion that Bots or Worms are an
exciting cause, the D.D., may be alternated with F.F.,
fifteen drops every half hour or hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>N. B.—In cases of colic the greatest danger and the
worst possible fault is injudicious haste and giving <i>too
many and improper things</i>. Thousands of horses are killed
by the drugs given to cure colic where one dies of the
disease itself. Give only <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Remedies</span>, and at
the intervals as directed, however urgent as the case may
appear. Your success and safety are in following the
directions implicitly.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tympanitis, Drum-Belly, or Wind-Colic</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is merely a form of colic characterized by an
enormous production of flatulence. The pain is sharper,
the animal more furious and violent than in ordinary
colic; the belly on both sides is more or less swelled with
wind; there are rumbling noises and frequent discharges
of wind. It is usually the result of eating or gorging
with green, flatulent food.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of F.F., every half
hour, or even more frequently if the case is very urgent.
It will soon be relieved. Afterwards, a few doses of J.K.,
fifteen drops morning and night, will be of benefit.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Enteritis, Inflammation of the Bowels, Red Colic</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There are two varieties of this disease, one in which
the external coats of the intestines are inflamed, and
attended with constipation, and the other, in which
there is irritation of the internal mucous surface of the
intestines, and attended with purging.</p>

<p class='c004'>The most frequent <span class='fss'>CAUSE</span> is sudden cold upon a warm,
perspiring skin, or even a cold drink when very hot;
over-fed horses, subjected to long and severe exercise,
are most liable to it; stones and hard dung in the bowels;
and especially colic badly treated, and drugged with all
sorts of medicines, often terminates in Inflammation of
the Bowels.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms of this disease are very like those of
colic, only in the latter disease there are intervals of rest,
or cessation of pain, and there is little or no alteration of
the pulse; whilst in inflammation of the bowels there is
<i>no abatement of the pain</i>, but the animal is continually
lying down and rolling about, getting up and then dropping
down suddenly. The pulse is very much quickened,
small and hard; the artery appears like a cord, under
the finger; the extremities are cold; the animal frequently
turns his head toward the flanks; the abdomen
is hard and tender; as the disease advances, the breathing
becomes accelerated, the eyes staring and wild, the
pulse imperceptible at the jaw; a cold sweat breaks out
over the whole body. This state continues for some
time, when suddenly the animal appears to get better, he
gets up, and stands quietly; the eyes lose their lustre, the
extremities become deadly cold, there is a tremulous
agitation of the muscles, particularly the fore part of the
body; after a short time, he begins to totter and stagger
about, and soon falls down headlong, and dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease begins, in most cases, with
dullness, heavy eyes, staring coat, restlessness and moving
about from one place to another; the pulse and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>breathing are both quickened; no appetite. Some cases
begin with colic, others with shivering. The animal
paws, kicks, and rolls about in the most violent manner
at first; often strains and tries to pass water, but either
none or only a few drops come away; the pain is most
intense, and does not cease for an instant, and is increased
by pressure and moving about; the belly is hot, tucked
up, and hard, unless there is wind in the bowels, when
it will be more or less swelled; the bowels are very costive,
though small, hard, dry masses may be passed, except in
cases where the internal surface, or mucous membrane,
is the seat of disease, in which case small, purging,
bloody stools are frequently passed; the legs and ears are
intensely cold; the pulse small and hard; and sweat in
the latter stages breaks out all over. Still further on, the
pulse becomes smaller and weaker, until it can scarcely
be felt; the breathing is quick, irregular, and attended
with sighs; the skin is covered with a cold, clammy
sweat; the eyes seem to have lost their power of seeing,
he becomes very weak; and trembles all over; convulsions
come on, and death soon follows.</p>

<p class='c004'>Consider carefully the distinctions between Colic and
inflammation, as given under the article on Colic.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—As early as possible, give fifteen drops of
A.A., and repeat the doses every half hour. After the
animal is somewhat relieved, continue the medicine at
longer intervals. If not better in two hours, the F.F.,
may be alternated with the A.A., at the intervals mentioned.
This will be especially indicated if there should
be frequent purging small stools, blood-stained or otherwise.
After the inflammatory symptoms have subsided,
give a dose or two of the J.K.</p>

<p class='c004'>N. B.—As constipation exists in inflammation of the
bowels, many persons suppose it to be the cause of the
disease, and resort to the most desperate means to remove
it. This is all wrong. Remove the inflammation, and
the bowels will then move of themselves, while the balls
and cathartics administered during the inflammation will
only increase the difficulty.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Peritonitis, Inflammation of the Peritoneum</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The delicate membrane lining the abdominal cavity,
and covering the parts within it, is termed the peritoneum,
and is occasionally the subject of inflammation.</p>

<p class='c004'>It not unfrequently follows the gelding of the horse,
especially if he is too soon afterwards turned out to grass,
or during cold and wet weather. Exposure to cold
standing in draughts of air, or drinking cold water may
produce it; and it follows a stab in the belly or a rupture
of some of the viscera, and the flow of the contents into
the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—A few days after cutting the colt, the yard
and sheath will be found swelled and painful; little or no
matter flows from the cut; the animal is restless and
uneasy; the body is painful when pressed against, and
is swelled with watery fluid; the legs are cold; the bowels
are bound; the skin is rough and dry; no food is eaten;
if loose, he rests his hind quarters on the side of the stall;
the swelling in the breast, legs and sheath increases; the
breathing becomes quick and painful; the pulse hard,
quick, and by degrees small and weak. These gradually
become worse, until the animal dies.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a slow form of this disease, as follows: poor
appetite; low spirits; uneasiness; occasional pawing the
ground; looking at the belly and groaning; belly painful
when pressed upon, and tucked up; quick breathing;
small, weak pulse; bound bowels; awkward way of walking
with the hind legs; mouth dry; and bad smelling;
body thin; coat staring and unthrifty; urine scanty;
weakness. As the disease advances, the abdomen fills
with a watery fluid, and the disease terminates as dropsy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—From the commencement, the A.A., is
the most important remedy, and may be given, fifteen
drops, every two hours, during the more urgent symptoms,
and then at longer intervals for the acute form.</p>

<p class='c004'>If there should be purging, alternate the F.F. with the
A.A., at intervals of two hours, and then leas frequently
as the disease improves.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>In the slow form of the disease, the alternate use of
J.K. and F.F., four times per day, will be found most
effectual in preventing a termination in dropsy, and in
restoring the animal.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Jaundice, Yellows, Diseased Liver</h4>

<p class='c010'>Young horses rarely have diseased livers, but at the
age of eight or nine years, the disease is more common,
and, in some cases, quite suddenly, the covering of the
liver gives way, and symptoms of fatal peritonitis appear.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Jaundice, or Yellows, is more frequent,
and is marked thus: The animal is dull, sleepy, and
unwilling to move; he eats little or nothing; the coat
stares; the urine is scanty; the dung light-colored and in
lumps. The nose, tongue, eyes and mouth become
yellow, from the abundance of bile in the blood. The
urine is very thick, dark-colored and full of bile. The
right side is painful when pressed against, and the horse
looks towards it, he may be lame in the right fore-leg, or
paw the ground with it. These symptoms may increase,
and cough, quick breathing, and full, quick pulse, be
added, which afterwards becomes quite weak and slow,
and the legs very cold. He then becomes more and more
dull, stupid and sleepy, staggers, falls to the ground,
and dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Rarely will anything more be required
than the J.K., of which a dose of fifteen drops may be
given, four times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should there be heat, fever or inflammatory symptoms,
a few doses of the A.A., will be proper, not merely for
the heat and fever, but for the obstruction of the liver as
well. In severe cases, these two remedies may be alternated
with the most brilliant success, even when there is
no fever apparent. Give fifteen drops every four hours,
alternately, first A.A., next J.K., and so on.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Costiveness, Bound Bowels</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is usually a mere symptom of some other disease,
upon the removal of which the costiveness disappears.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>But sometimes, in consequence of dry food, deficient
action of the liver, want of exercise, or a paralytic condition
of the digestive organs, it may require attention.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The animal should have regular exercise,
green food or bran mashes night and morning, with but
little oats, or other heating or dry food. Give fifteen
drops of J.K., night and morning, and the condition will
soon be corrected.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bots and Worms</h4>

<p class='c010'>Bots in the horse, like worms in the human system,
have usually a great many sins to answer for, which are
really chargeable elsewhere. It is a principle in the
economy of nature, that one animal should feed upon or
live within another, and hence every animal, and almost
every organ, also, has its peculiar parasite or inhabitant.
Such parasites are rarely injurious. In an unhealthy
condition of the system, they may unduly accumulate,
and occasion some inconvenience, but they rarely feed
upon the surface to which they are attached, but only
upon the contents of the organs in which they exist.</p>

<p class='c004'>The history of the bot, the most formidable of horse
parasites, is as follows: Towards the close of autumn, the
female gadfly (octrus equi) fixes its eggs upon the hair
of the horse’s legs, by means of a sticky substance,
exuded with the egg. By means of the horse’s tongue
and lips, these eggs are carried to the mouth, and so on
down to the stomach, where the eggs, farther developed
in the form of grubs, are attached, by means of their
hooks, to the sides of the organ, while their heads remain
floating in its fluids, upon which they feed. Having
arrived at maturity, they are separated, pass along the
intestines, and are expelled with the dung, after which
they again burst their shell, and rise in the summer in
the form of the gadfly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Some horses are supposed to suffer much
from bots, while others, in the most perfect health, have
an abundance of them. Often there are no symptoms to
indicate their presence, but generally, the horse loses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>flesh and strength, and can scarcely move about; he has
turns of griping pains in the belly; eats and drinks
greedily; the oats pass off undigested, and the dung has
a bad smell. The only sure criterion of the existence of
bots or worms is their presence, hanging about the anus,
or mixed with the dung of the animal.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are also the <i>long round worms</i>, similar to the
common earth worm, and the <i>small pin-norm</i>, half an
inch or more in length, which show at the anus, an inch
or more in length, which often causes itching and uneasiness
at the anus.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—To eradicate worms or bots from the
system, give fifteen drops of D.D., each night and morning,
with regular and healthy feed, and the worm
symptoms will soon disappear.</p>

<p class='c004'>For Colic or belly-ache, when supposed to be from
bots, give fifteen drops of the D.D., alternately with the
A.A., every half hour or hour, according to the urgency
of the case. A few doses will usually relieve.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>In obstinate cases</span>, when the Bots seem to be constitutional,
give fifteen drops of the D.D., every morning,
and the same of J.K., every night, and so continue until
good health is established.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Salivation—Slavering</h4>

<p class='c010'>Many horses are subject to an increased flow of saliva
from the mouth, constituting what is known as <i>slavering</i>
or <i>driveling</i> from the mouth. The discharge is commonly,
simply glairy slime, or at times—and especially on being
driven or excited—a simple froth, dropping or being blown
from the mouth. It may be caused by mercury if the
horse has been dosed with the drug; is often attributed to
Lobelia or Indian tobacco, if the horse only would eat it—but
is more commonly the result of swelled gums,
irregular or deficient teeth, and irritated or inflamed
salivary glands, the result of bad digestion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—See that the teeth are in order, and give
J.K., morning and night.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE URINARY AND REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Nephritis, Inflammation of the Kidneys</h4>

<p class='c010'>The kidneys are not unfrequently the subject of inflammation
in the horse. It may be induced by powerful or
repeated diuretics, such as saltpetre, which is a most
dangerous medicine, or from hard and long riding by a
heavy rider, or heavy weights; or by leaping or being
suddenly pulled up on his haunches, the inflammation
being propagated from the lumbar muscles to the kidneys,
or by exposure to cold and wet, by rain dripping upon
his loins during exercise, and especially if these organs
have been previously weakened.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The early symptoms are those of fever, the
pulse full, hard and quickened, afterward becomes small
and weak; the horse looks around anxiously at his
flanks; stands with his hind legs wide apart; is unwilling
to lie down; straddles as he walks; expresses pain in
turning; the back is somewhat arched; he shrinks when
the loins are pressed upon, and there is some degree of
heat felt there. The urine is voided in small quantities;
frequently is high-colored, and sometimes bloody; and
there is frequent and often violent effort and straining,
but the discharge is very small, sometimes suppressed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of H.H., and repeat
every two hours. Should there be very high fever, great
heat, etc., the A.A., may be alternated with it, giving
fifteen drops every intermediate hour in urgent cases, but
in general the H.H., will be quite sufficient, and should
be continued at prolonged intervals to entire recovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>But a few doses will be required to show us the great
value and efficacy of the remedy.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Cistitis, Inflammation of the Bladder</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease is usually the result of giving diuretics,
such as saltpetre, cantharides, or similar irritating medicines.
It may also be the effect of a cold and exposure,
or of a stone in the bladder, and the disease may occupy
the neck of the bladder, or the organ itself. The symptoms
are similar to that of Inflammation of the Kidneys;
the horse makes frequent and painful attempts to stale,
but passes only a few drops of water at a time. The
bladder cannot retain the urine from its excessive irritability,
so that the attempt to void it is constantly going
on. The urine may be clear, or mixed with mucus, or
stained with blood.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Treatment</span> is the same as for Inflammation of the
Kidneys, the remedy for that disease, H.H., being given
every two hours, in doses of fifteen drops, or less frequently,
according to the urgency of the case. In some
cases the A.A., may be given in alternation, as for
Inflammation of the Kidneys; but in general, the remedy
first mentioned H.H., will be found every way efficient
and available.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hematuria, or Bloody Urine</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is usually a mere symptom of some other disease.
Blows, or a violent strain of the loins, some kinds of
irritating plants, stones in the kidneys or bladder; ulceration
of the bladder; Spanish flies given internally or
administered as a blister—may either of them produce
bloody urine as a symptom.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms are: discharge of urine, mixed more or
less with blood, or containing clots. When the blood is
caused by some disease of the kidney, there is usually
pain in walking, straddling of the hind legs, and an awkward
way of walking. If the blood comes from the
kidneys, it will be intimately mixed with the urine; but
if from the bladder, it will pass off with the last of the
urine rather than the first.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Fifteen drops of the H.H., given three
times per day, will generally promptly relieve. If dependent
upon organic disease, more time may be required,
but the remedy is the same. If it fails, give a large
spoonful of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, poured
upon the tongue three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Retention of Urine</h4>

<p class='c010'>From holding the urine too long, cramp or spasm of
the neck of the bladder, stone in the bladder, or other
disease, which prevents the bladder contracting upon its
contents, there may be retention, and the animal unable
to void his urine.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms are similar to those in colic, but
characterized, however, by the horse putting himself in
the attitude of staling, and straining with great force, as
in the act of passing water, without any, or very little,
being discharged. This symptom may be present in cases
of gripes or colic, the bladder acting in sympathy with
the cramped intestine. All doubt may be removed by
inserting the hand into the rectum, when the bladder, if
full, will be found large, tense and full of water.</p>

<p class='c004'>This disease may be recognized by the animal frequently
putting himself in a position to pass urine, but without
succeeding, or at most only a few drops are voided; there
is also great restlessness, shifting from place to place,
moaning, looking at the flanks, pawing with the fore-feet.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A few doses, fifteen drops each, of the
H.H., given at intervals of two hours, will usually
relax the spasm and afford entire relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it is the result of a stone in the bladder, the
movements of the horse may for a time dislodge it, but
an entire cure will only be effected by an operation, for
which a veterinary surgeon must be consulted.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Scanty Urine</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a mere symptom of some other disease, such as
fever, inflammation, or other morbid condition, or it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>may occur naturally, if there is diarrhea, loose bowels, or
purging, and it always occurs in warm weather, when a
horse is severely worked, from the large quantity of fluid
exhaled from the skin and lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few doses, fifteen drops each, of the H.H., will soon
correct the condition, as far as the health of the animal
requires. The J.K., for indigestion is likewise efficient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diuresis, too Profuse Staling</h4>

<p class='c010'>In consequence of bad food, such as kiln-dried oats,
mow-burnt hay, or of such medicines as nitre, or other
diuretics, a horse may have an excessive flow of urine.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms are: The horse does not eat much, sweats
easily, is soon tired, the bowels are costive, skin dry and
coat rough, tongue white and there is great thirst. The
water is quite clear and milky, passed often, and in large
quantities. As the disease advances, the horse eats little,
he gets thinner and weaker every day, breath often
offensive; the dung is hard, lumpy and covered with slime;
the hair stands on end, and the flow of urine becomes
enormous. If not cured, death ensues.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The food must be changed, and none but
the best given. Change of food is always of service under
such circumstances.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give fifteen drops of J.K., four times per day. This
will often be efficient.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diabetes Mellitis</span>, which is a rare disease in the horse
should not be confounded with <span class='sc'>Diuresis</span>, which is manifested
by an <i>increased</i> flow of urine. In Diabetes Mellitis
the water is clear or greenish, limpid, <i>sweetish</i>, and soon
accompanied with great debility and loss of flesh, usually
ending fatally.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Parturition in Mares</h4>

<p class='c010'>Rarely requires either manual or medicinal assistance.
A dose of A.A., given in the earlier stages of labor often
quiets the restlessness and allays the wandering pains,
and this conduces to the greater regularity of the process.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>If the labor becomes tedious or delays, a dose of G.G.,
repeated if necessary every two hours, will relax the
parts and assist the expulsion pains.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Self-Abuse, Seminal Emissions</h4>

<p class='c010'>A very common habit among race horses is self-abuse.
As soon as young horses are stabled, from idleness, over-excitement
or urinary irritation, they may begin to
masturbate, and it very often increases, impairing their
strength, and rendering them worthless and uncertain
foal-getters, or demanding castration. The phenomena
are well known and do not require a particular description.</p>

<p class='c004'>The common practice with horsemen or trainers is to
put on them what is called a “net,” an apron armed
with sharp pointed tacks, so when the yard is protruded,
the tacks prick him, and he draws it in. But many
horses, with a little practice, become so expert that they
can avoid striking the apron, and in most cases it seems
rather to increase than diminish the habit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The usual Veterinary Surgeons advise camphor, which,
if given is sufficiently large quantities to diminish the
habit, will notably and permanently impair the vitality
and vigor of the horse.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Dr. Humphreys’ Veterinary Remedies</span>, by <i>arresting</i>
and <i>lessening</i> the <i>irritation</i> and <i>morbid desire</i>, <i>prevent the
habit</i>, and thus, reducing the morbid desire, promote and
increase the natural vigor and development of the animal.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give fifteen drops of G.G., three times
per day, or if urinary irritation is suspected use the H.H.
instead. He should also have good food and plenty of
regular exercise. If unable to give him exercise under
saddle, he may be turned into a large pasture with
pregnant mares.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Weak or Deficient Sexual Vigor; Impotence in Stallions</h4>

<p class='c010'>It not unfrequently happens that stallions of even good
form and breed, and not deficient from inherited weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>or vice become uncertain or partially unfitted for
foal-getting. This must of necessity arise late in life
from failing vitality, or deficient natural strength. But
it not unfrequently happens as a result of too early severe
use, a drain put upon the young at a time when nature
was still building up and hardening tissue, and when the
over-drain made upon the green and yet unhardened
sire, was more than the nutrition could repair. And it is
again liable to happen from excessive use during the
healthy, vigorous age of life, and the more so, if coupled
with insufficient proper nourishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any or all of these causes may render a stallion uncertain,
and so diminish his value and the relative value
of his services. It becomes important to know what
treatment will restore the feeble and uncertain, and will
preserve and arrest the decay, as well as restore these
waning powers.</p>

<p class='c004'>In order to restore and invigorate the deficient or
waning powers, and to sustain them under severe tax,
or upon the decline life, the J.K., may be given in
confidence that it will sustain, restore and keep in vigor
the natural virile powers.</p>

<p class='c004'>In cases, with only some decline in vigor, a dose of
fifteen drops of J.K., given two or three times per week
is sufficient. When the want of vigor is more decided, a
dose, two or even three times per day may be given.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Failure to come in Heat—Sterility</h4>

<p class='c010'>Failure to breed in the mare may occur in two different
forms—first impotence, in which the mare fails to come in
heat, and second, true sterility, in which, although she
came in heat and was bred the service proved unfruitful.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first of these cases may be due to some malformation
of the sexual organs in which case it is incurable;
but it is more often due to insufficient or over-feed, or
lack of exercise, or over-work, or some depressing disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Correct the exercise and feeding, and give
G.G., every night for a week, or, if the case is urgent, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>dose morning and night, and then a dose daily until the
result is manifest.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>True Sterility</span> may also be caused by malformations
and be incurable, but is more often caused by other
things such as a catarrhal condition of the vagina—Leucorrhea
or too ardent heat, or insufficient food, or
debility from disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Treatment</span> for Leucorrhea or a catarrhal condition
of the organs, which may be known by a constant or
frequent discharge from the vagina, give G.G., each
morning and J.K., at night, and continue this for several
weeks, or until she is again served.</p>

<p class='c004'>In addition dissolve one cake of fresh compressed yeast
in a pint of tepid water, then after a few hours, add
another pint. Then wash the vagina well with soap and
water and use the dissolved yeast as a douche, this should
be done daily for several days.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where there is an excess of excitement, too ardent or
too frequent, or even constant heat, give at first, H.H., a
dose morning and night, for two or three weeks, then a
dose or two of G.G., and the result will usually be
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where there is unthriftiness or want of good condition,
correct the feeding and give G.G., morning and J.K., at
night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Abortion</h4>

<p class='c010'>Abortion or premature birth may occur from three
different causes:</p>

<p class='c004'>1—<span class='sc'>Accidental Abortion.</span>—Caused by a blow; strain;
slipping on a wet floor, over-strain from pulling a heavy
load, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—<span class='sc'>Enzootic Abortion.</span>—Due to some infectious disease
of the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—<span class='sc'>Contagious Abortion.</span>—A distinct disease which
causes the death and expulsion of the fetus or its
expulsion in a feeble state prior to the normal period.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms of Threatened Abortion.</span>—In the first three
months of pregnancy, the appearance of a bloody, watery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>or mucous discharge from the vagina. In the later
months, uneasiness, swelling, heat and tenderness about
the udder; secretion of milk; and straining as if in labor.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Threatened Abortion.</span>—Give fifteen
drops of G.G., every six hours, and the dose may be
repeated two or three or more times should the threatening
symptoms continue after the first or even the second
dose has expended its action.</p>

<p class='c004'>This interval should elapse between doses, as too rapid
ones may even defeat the object, by over-excitement of
the system, while a single dose often arrests an abortion
if permitted to expand its action.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a mare has actually aborted, it is almost impossible
to tell whether it occurred from contagious
abortion or from some other cause, so the safe thing to
do is to act as if it had been contagious abortion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Contagious Abortion.</span>—The fetus and
membranes should be burned. The premises occupied
by the sick animal should be disinfected as follows:
Remove all bedding and dirt possible and spray all
available parts of barn with 3% formalin or 5% carbolic
acid solution. Apply white wash containing 1 lb. chloride
of lime to 3 gallons of whitewash, scatter quicklime on
floor and gutters.</p>

<p class='c004'>The animal which has aborted should receive daily a
vaginal irrigation of two gallons of warm water containing
2% lysol until the vaginal discharge stops. The
external parts about the vagina, including the hips and
tail, should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and
then with the lysol solution as above, twice daily. This
should also be done to all exposed pregnant animals in
the herd, being careful not to use the same cloth, solution,
bucket or attendant for the well animals that was
used for the sick one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also give G.G., at intervals of six hours.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X.—<span class='sc'>Part I.</span><br> <span class='c007'>GENERAL DISEASES</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Rheumatism</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a far more common disease of the horse than
has generally been supposed. It is quite common in old
horses, and in younger ones that have been exposed or
over-worked. Cold and damp, and exposure to draughts
of cold air when heated, or during and after severe effort
or work, are among the most common causes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—It usually begins with a shivering chill,
hot skin and mouth. The horse becomes lame and stiff
all over, and several joints seem affected at once, so
that he cannot move from the first, or else it soon becomes
confined to one joint or leg; the joint or limb becomes
very hot, swelled, and exceedingly painful; the pulse is
quicker at one time than another, or stops now and then
for a moment or two; the breathing is quick; sweats
break out, and the animal becomes weak. When the
disease attacks the fore legs, farriers call it “chest-founder”;
and when it attacks the loins, the back is
raised and belly tucked up, and it is known as “loin-bound.”
Rheumatism not unfrequently shifts from one
place to another, especially if the animal is exposed to
wet and cold.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If there should be considerable heat and
fever, as is most commonly the case, give first A.A., a
dose of fifteen drops, every two or three hours, until the
heat has been partially subdued, or until six doses has been
given. Then alternate the B.B., with the A.A., every
three or four hours, a dose of fifteen drops, until the
animal is restored. If a limb or joint is painful, hot and
swelled, bathe it in <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>
night and morning, and a flannel bandage applied to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>limb will also be of great service, in addition to the
internal medicines.</p>

<p class='c004'>If at any time a horse shows symptoms of stiffness or
lameness, fifteen drops of B.B., night and morning, will
soon remove it.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Chronic Rheumatism</h4>

<p class='c010'>May be regarded as a continuance of an acute attack,
or as is more frequent a recurrence of it, being generally
milder in character and less painful. The general circulation,
as indicated by the pulse and respiration, is not
much affected, and the manifestation of the disease is
usually confined to some form of lameness usually affecting
one limb at a time. Suddenness of the attack and
change of its locality are characteristic of the disease.
Often after having been apparently cured it returns after
an uncertain interval or appears in another locality.
Limbs and tissues that have once suffered are more liable
to a recurrence, and it may be generally assumed that
when a horse has once had a siege of rheumatism and
again has sudden lameness and pain, that it is a return
of the old disorder. Bad weather, exposure, or over-work
are the most frequent occasions of a recurrence of
the attack. The lameness most frequently attacks one or
the other leg, or there may be a general stiffness or
lameness. Not unfrequently the lumbar or loin muscles
become the principal seat of the disease and the term
<i>lumbago</i> or <i>loin-bound</i> is applied to it; or when the
muscles or fibrous tissues of the shoulder become affected,
causing lameness of the forelegs, the animal is said to
have chest founder.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—B.B., is usually the best remedy. If
there is fever, heat or some lameness, alternate A.A., and
B.B., a dose every two hours. In old cases, and to
eradicate the disease from the system, give B.B., morning
and noon, and J.K., at night, not forgetting an occasional
dose of H.H., to increase the action of the kidneys.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Fever—Swamp Fever—Blood Poisoning</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Fever</span> is always a symptom of some other disease, never
a disease of itself. An injury to any part of an animal,
may, by sympathy, set up a fever in the rest of the body.
However there are some cases where the fever is the
most pronounced symptom, as in Swamp Fever and Septicemia
or Blood Poisoning.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Swamp Fever</span> or infectious Anemia is an infectious
disease attacking Horses and Mules. It is characterized
by high fever and loss of flesh and strength, with intervals
of comparative good health, with no fever and a voracious
appetite and the animal apparently getting well; only to
be succeeded by another attack of fever, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Since the disease can be readily caught
by the other horses and mules, separate the sick from the
well. Then give the A.A. and I.I., alternately in doses
of fifteen drops, at intervals of two hours at first, and
later at longer intervals as the animal improves.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Blood Poisoning</span> or Septicemia is the poisoning of the
blood by germs or their products. It occurs more or less in
all infectious diseases, but particularly the infection caused
by a wound.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms are fever, rapid pulse, depression and
weakness with sometimes chills.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In all cases of Fever, the A.A., is the first
and generally the only remedy required. Give fifteen
drops at intervals of two or three hours, at first, and by
degrees at longer intervals as the animal improves.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Glanders and Farcy</h4>

<p class='c010'>The disease is termed Glanders when it is principally
confined to the head and nose, and called Farcy when
manifesting itself in the lymphatics.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms of Glanders.</span>—<i>Constant</i> discharge from one
or both nostrils, more frequently from one, and that the
left; the discharge is at first thin and watery, afterward
thick like the white of egg. It may continue in this way
for some time, or it soon becomes more mattery, sticky,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>then greenish or yellowish, or mixed with streaks of
blood, and having a bad smell. Soon after this discharge
is noticed, the glands under the jaw become painful and
swollen, and one of them appears fixed to the jaw-bone.
Then the membrane lining the inside of the nose has a
yellowish or leaden color, which is considered characteristic
of the disease; small bladders are noticed upon it,
which afterward are changed to ulcers; these have sharp
borders, and spread and deepen until the gristle and
bones beneath become ulcerated. When ulcers appear
upon the membrane of the nose, the constitution of the
horse is evidently involved; he loses flesh; his belly is
tucked up; coat unthrifty and the hair readily comes off;
the appetite impaired; the strength fails; cough, more or
less urgent, may be heard; the lungs become filled with
abscesses, wasting goes on, and the animal soon dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Farcy.</span>—Upon the face, lips and other portions of the
body, but especially upon the legs, hard, painful and hot
lumps are felt, which are called <i>Farcy buds</i>; they increase
in size, with pain and heat, until the ulceration works
through the skin and a thin discharge flows out. Between
these lumps along the course of the lymphatics, hardened
cords are felt; the groin, inside the thighs, and space
between the fore legs and chest, become, from the tumefaction
of these lymphatics, swelled and very painful; the
legs are swelled, together with the usual discharge of
glanders.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In suspected cases were the disease is not
well developed or recognized give fifteen drops of the
C.C., every two hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>N. B.—It should be remembered that a well marked
case of glanders is <i>highly contagious</i>. Not only may the
disease be communicated to other animals, but the
glandered matter coming in contact with a cut, abraded
or sore surface in the human subject, will be liable to
result as a very severe, if not fatal, case of poisoning.
Prudence demands that we should handle such animals
with great caution, and a thoroughly glandered animal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>had much better be killed at once than endanger other
animals or the lives of human beings, and the more so as
the chance of recovery in such a case is very remote.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Lymphatics, or Weed</h4>

<p class='c010'>In some rare cases horses suffer from Inflammation of
the Lymphatics, manifested by cord-like swellings along
the course of these vessels. It may be brought on by
sudden changes of food, cold and wet weather, sudden
over-work after several days of rest, disordered stomach,
standing in cold water, exposure to drafts of air etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Symptoms</span> are as follows: The attack is usually
sudden, beginning with a cold, shivering chill, followed
by full, strong and quick pulse, accelerated breathing;
hot, dry mouth, and general fever. The local manifestation
is on one of the hind legs, generally the left, or in
rare instances, a fore-leg may be affected. The leg is
lifted from the ground, is hot and painful to the touch,
and swells <i>from above downward</i>. The swelling increases
rapidly, the leg becomes much larger than the other, the
pain increases, and the leg is very sensitive to the touch.
Several hard, round and very painful cord-like swellings
may be felt on the inside of the leg; these end in small,
hardish lumps, and are more painful than the cords. A
watery fluid exudes from the skin, and may be seen in
drops standing upon the hair.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—At the commencement, foment the limb
for an hour, night and morning, with hot water, and
afterward apply <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>
freely. The horse should have plenty of exercise, and
in most cases may be ordered to his work, continuing the
medicine as hereinafter directed. Give, three times per
day, fifteen drops of the A.A. After a few days, the
J.K., may be alternated with the former with advantage.
But in general the A.A., will be entirely sufficient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Purpura Hemorrhagica</h4>

<p class='c010'>Some rare cases of this disease have been observed in
the horse. It consists essentially of a decomposition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the blood, and loss of power in the capillary vessels, as
the result of which echymosed or black and blue spots
appear on the surface, and upon the mucous membrane
wherever it can be seen, hemorrhages occur from various
parts of the body and are thrown off with the natural
excretions. The inside of the nose is covered with purple
spots, as also the inside of the lips. These spots vary in
size, and are filled with dark-colored fluid blood, which
exudes if they are punctured or scratched. There is
diffused swelling over the system, showing itself at the
eyelids, breast, flank, belly, quarters, and between the
thighs, extending upward. It is attended with weakness
and general prostration of the system, swelling and
stiffening of the joints, and sloughing off of the membrane
of the nose, or other parts.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The A.A., will be found appropriate in
all cases of this disease. Give a dose of fifteen drops
three times per day. If there are hemorrhages from any
organ, give half a gill of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch
Hazel</span> three times per day, between doses of the A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give common food of good quality, less oats and hay,
but especially carrots and potatoes. The last are very
serviceable in this disease.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Big Jaw—Actinomycosis</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is caused by the Ray fungus which is
sometimes found on barley, oats, cactus, dried grass, etc.,
and which enters the body of the animal through cuts or
wounds on the tongue, gums, etc., and particularly with
young animals at teething time.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—These of course vary with the position of
the wound, through which the fungus entered the body.
If on the tongue, the tongue becomes swollen and very
painful “wooden tongue.” If around the teeth, the jaw
becomes swollen and finally the growth breaks through
the skin or into the mouth. If through the skin of the
head or neck, large nodules appear, varying in size from
a hazel nut to a man’s fist.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The most successful treatment is by
cutting out the nodules; this of course should be done
by a Veterinary Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c004'>We advise calling a Veterinary Surgeon and having
him perform the operation as soon as possible, as the
disease is usually curable if properly handled and it cannot
be transmitted to man or to the other animals.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Azoturia</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is somewhat common, and is often considered
a paralysis from this most frequently prominent
symptom. But this condition is really due to imperfect
action of the liver and kidneys in failing to eliminate only
partially oxidized products and the transformation of
albuminoids into urea—thus producing the train of
symptoms constituting the disease. It mostly attacks
animals out at grass, or those who have been for a time
idle on good feed, and are then put to active exercise or
work; beans, peas, or other like foods are also liable to
produce it. The autumn is its most frequent season of
attack and mares seem to be more liable to it than
geldings.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—These come on suddenly and without premonitions
of disease. The animal may be attacked in the
stable after having been out for a short time, after a
period of rest. In the milder cases there is only some
<i>lameness</i> and <i>muscular trembling</i> of a particular limb,
generally the hind ones, without apparent cause, and
on examination there is a dusky brown color of the
membrane of the eye and nose, and some tenderness of
the ribs when struck; the lameness may be such that the
animal may be scarcely able to walk, or may even go
down altogether. In other cases the horse is struck down
at once from loss of motive power in the loins and hind
legs after having been driven only a short time after an
interval of rest. In other cases the attack is not so
sudden, the animal becomes very restless, perspires freely,
seems to be in violent pain, the flanks heave, the nostrils
are dilated, the face pinched, the body trembles violently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and shows a disposition to lie down, and very soon, if
not already present, the characteristic symptoms appear.
These are, <i>tremors</i> and <i>violent spasmodic twitchings</i> of the
<i>large muscles of the back</i>, <i>loins</i> and <i>hips</i>, ending in contractions,
with more or less loss of motive power. The
body trembles violently, the limbs become weak so that
they sway and bend, the animal walks crouchingly
behind, and soon goes down unable to support himself,
the urine discharged is high-colored, thick, and has a
strong ammoniacal odor; the pulse varies from 60 to 80
beats per minute, generally weak though sometimes
strong; temperature from 102 to 104.5 Fahrenheit, or
even higher. The bowels may be regular, and in mild
attacks the appetite is not impaired.</p>

<p class='c004'>In severe cases the animal lies prostrate, plainly unable
to rise, refuses to eat or drink, struggles violently in his
attempts to raise himself, and coma (insensibility) may
supervene; in such cases the conjunctive mucous membrane
of the eyes is much congested.</p>

<p class='c004'>In <i>very</i> violent cases the animal is suddenly struck
down, struggles violently for a few hours, becomes comatose
and dies.</p>

<p class='c004'>In milder cases the severe symptoms abate, but the
animal does not regain the use of its limbs, and though
it may eat and remain perfectly conscious, is unable to
rise and ultimately dies from some complication.</p>

<p class='c004'>In favorable cases the trembling, twitches and spasms
abate, the urine becomes more natural, the power of
movement returns, and in a few days the animal is convalescent,
often having for some time a swelling across
the breast like a pad as a result of the dropsical infiltration
of this depending tissue.</p>

<p class='c004'>In other cases, the loss of power in certain muscles
remains for a long time, and yet in other cases cerebral
complications and death may ensue as a result of defective
urinary secretion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Is much more favorable under our method
than by the usual course. Give at first A.A., a dose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>every hour for six or eight hours to relieve the vascular
excitement and increase the action of the liver and
kidneys, then give the J.K., in alternation with A.A., at
intervals of two hours between doses. Continue these
two Remedies for say twenty-four hours, or even longer,
and when the animal is easier, and more especially if the
urine has <i>not yet become more free and natural</i>, interpose
H.H., in alternation with J.K., at intervals of three or
four hours between doses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later on and for remaining complications, if such
exist, give J.K., and H.H., two doses of each per day in
alternation.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Anthrax—Charbon</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is an epizootic disease with quite an ancient
history, mostly prevalent in the deltas, low grounds and
river bottoms of our far Southern States. At times it
prevails over certain sections, carrying off hundreds and
even thousands of horses and mules, while other seasons
are measurably free from its ravages.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is caused by a germ which enters the body through
the mouth on food or water or through a cut in the skin.
The anthrax germ is very difficult to destroy and a stable
or pasture once infected will remain so for many years.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Usually for some hours before the disease
is manifested externally, the affected animal will appear
languid, the ears droop and signs of general depression
may be noticed, followed by vertigo and colic, slight
swellings soon make their appearance. These swellings
are at first about the size of a walnut, or the end of one’s
finger or thumb, are round or slightly irregular in shape,
but are always adherent to a pedicle at the base. They
are painful and the parts around them are sensitive;
when touched with the finger, a local shivering, like a
sub-cutaneous beating is distinctly felt. They are
variously located, but nearly always upon dependent
parts, as under the neck and breast, between the front
and hind legs, along the lower part of the chest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and belly, and on the sheath and teats. The sheath in
some animals is so enormously swelled as to interfere with
urination. The swellings are rarely seen upon the back.
Nearly all animals not treated, die in from twelve to
thirty-six hours after the first symptoms are noted, the
temperature rising to 105 before death.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This disease is recognized as being incurable,
and generally fatal. In suspected cases, give
A.A., every two hours, until the animal improves or the
disease becomes thoroughly developed, in which latter
case the animal should be killed at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>The carcass of the animal and everything connected
with it should be burned, and the entire premises
thoroughly disinfected as given under contagious abortion,

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='c007'>PART II</span><br> Diseases of Cattle</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='c007'>GENERAL DISEASES</span></h3>
<h4 class='c009'>Black Leg</h4>

<p class='c010'>Black Leg affects cattle when from three months to
two years old, younger or older than this they rarely
have it. It comes from a well known germ, the Bacillus
Chanvoei, which enters the system through a cut or
scratch, such as produced by thorns, barbed wire, etc.
The disease cannot be transmitted to man.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The chief characteristic of this disease is
the swellings which may appear on any part of the body,
except the tail or below the knee or hock. The thigh
and shoulder are most commonly attacked. The swellings
rapidly increase in number and may run together.
They give a crackling sensation on pressure and are cool
and without tenderness in the center. If opened in the
center there is no pain and a frothy fluid comes out.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are also general symptoms as follows: the animal
does not eat or chew the cud, loss of strength and general
depression, high fever, lameness, stiffness and often
dragging of one leg on account of the swellings. These
symptoms increase as the disease progresses, the breathing
becomes faster, the animal groans and may have
attacks of colic. The animal almost always dies in from
one and one-half to three days.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The disease is incurable, and diseased
animals should be killed at once, the bodies burned and
the premises disinfected as given under Abortion, page <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>.
The healthy animals should be moved to another pasture
and the infected pasture burned off the following winter,
this destroys the germs in that pasture.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Cattle may be rendered immune to Black Leg by
vaccination. The vaccine with directions for its use is
given away to stock owners by the Chief of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Foot and Mouth Disease—Eczema Epizootica</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—An acute, contagious fever, characterized
by the formation of vesicles and ulcers, chiefly about the
mouth and hoofs, etc. The eruptions appear on the
mucous membrane of the mouth, on the fetlock,
and in the cleft of the hoofs, and not unfrequently as a
eruption on the udder. The disorder chiefly prevails
among cattle and sheep, but under favoring circumstances,
also attacks other domestic quadrupeds, and even man.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—It appears as an epidemic, and spreads
exclusively by contagion. The precise nature of the germ
is unknown, but it is chiefly limited to the contents of the
vesicles, the secretion of the ulcers, the saliva, the blood
and the natural secretions and excretions, of the diseased
animal; and these convey the disease. The predisposing
causes are exposure to cold, wet, currents of cold air, poor
fodder, want of cleanliness and good housing; and anything
that tends to lower the constitutional vitality. The
activity of the virus is preserved for many months. The
poison may be conveyed by the clothes of herdsmen and
other persons, by manure, tools, fodder, by grass and
ground previously trodden by diseased animals, and milk
to sucking calves, indeed by almost anything. It finds
its way into the system in various ways, not depending
on any wound for admission. The communication to
man is by drinking the milk of diseased cows. A second
attack is rare.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—After a period of incubation, lasting from
three to six days, the animal is seized with a shivering
fit, and appears dull and stupified. A vesicular eruption
soon appears on the mouth, the hoofs, and the teats.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Sucking calves have a similar eruption on the fauces and
pharynx, with irritation of the whole alimentary canal,
attended with inability to suck, and exhausting diarrhea.
The eyes are then observed to be dim, watery, congested;
the muzzle, ears and horns alternately hot and cold;
shivering ensues; rumination is diminished; the milk is
less in quantity, yellower and thicker than usual, and
much deteriorated in quality; the bag swollen, tender,
hot; the back arched; the coat staring and harsh; the
pulse somewhat accelerated; the temperature moderately
elevated, reaching 102°, or even 104°; the eruption in the
month is first seen on the inner surface of the upper lip,
the edge of the upper jaw where there are no teeth, on
the tip and edges of the tongue, and is indicated by
salivation, by pain and loss of power in taking and eating
food. The vesicles occur on the mucous membrane,
singly or in patches, first as little red spots, then as
whitish-yellow, slightly turbid blisters, about the size of
a bean, at first transparent, but subsequently filled with
a puriform fluid. These vesicles burst in about eighteen
hours, discharge their fluid, leaving behind shallow
ulcers, which often run together and then form deep and
ragged ulcers. The lips, cheeks, tongue, and sometimes
the Schneiderian membrane, are affected. The eruption
on the feet is first seen around the coronet and in the
interdigital space, especially of the hind legs; and the
resulting vesicles burst quickly, because of the animal’s
movements. The animal evidently suffers intense pain,
is lame or unable to stand, and moves reluctantly or
cautiously; the hoofs swell; the vascular secreting membranes
become inflamed; the hoofs are cast; the bones
may become diseased; and serious mischief may ensue.
The eruption on the udder turns to vesicles, as in the
mouth, and, when the fluid dries or escapes, thin scales
are formed. The teats are swollen and sore. In exceptional
cases, a vesicular eruption appears on the muzzle,
the mucous membrane of the nostrils, the conjunctivae
of the eyes, and the mucous membrane of the vagina.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>In favorable cases, the fever subsides about the fourth
day, the eruption declines, the appetite returns, and in
seven to fourteen days the animal recovers. But complications
are not uncommon. And in unfavorable cases
the fever is high, the ulceration increases, the animal
suffers from exhaustion, wasting, discharge of stringy,
bloody mucous from the mouth, and of offensive matter
from the nostrils; the face is swollen, the breath foul, the
respiration rapid and grunting; the pulse small, weak,
rapid; the blood becomes impure; the belly and legs
œdematous; the hoofs slough off; diarrhea supervenes,
and death follows about the ninth or tenth day. An
aggravation may occur in milch cows by the bursting of
the vesicles when the teat is grasped in milking, for the
fluid escapes, the sore bleeds and ulcer spreads; and
though the sore be scabbed over between the milking
times, the scab is then again pulled off. The consequence
is that the cow, feeling intense pain and irritation, kicks,
resents the milking, holds back the milk, and thus prevents
the “stripping” of the udder. The effect of this
may be an attack of inflammation of the udder, which
may prove fatal, or may be followed by induration and
atrophy of the udder. Or abscesses may form in the
udder, and sometimes large portions of it slough away,
rendering the cow comparatively useless for milking
purposes. Abortion is not uncommon.</p>

<p class='c004'>This disease may be easily mistaken for Stomatitis,
cow pox or fowl of the foot. However in Stomatitis
there is no eruption on the foot; and in cow pox and fowl
of the foot there is no eruption on the muzzle.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prognosis.</span>—This is unfavorable—The United States
Government and the Health Officers of the several States
require all suspected cases of Foot and Mouth Disease to
be quarantined, and upon the full development of the
disease all animals infected, to be killed. Human beings
are liable to become infected, great care should be exercised
in handling diseased animals or their carcases.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Rheumatism</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease is almost invariably the consequence of
cold and wet, or chill after over-exertion. The symptoms
are as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>Dullness; loss of spirits; disinclination to move, and
painful stiffness of the back or joints when moving; loss
of appetite; pain in the back, manifested by the animal
flinching when pressed upon; the joints, one or more,
become affected, and the animal prefers to lie down, and
cannot move without great pain and difficulty; the joints,
or one or more of them, become swelled, and are also
exceedingly hot and tender to the touch. In some cases,
there is considerable heat and fever, in others, it is but
slight. The complaint is quite liable to return from exposure,
changes of weather, or even the wind blowing
from a different quarter. The disease not unfrequently
changes from one joint or limb to another.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The B.B., is for all the usual forms of
this disease, giving twenty drops, three or four times per
day, in severe cases, and morning and night in the mild
ones.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the disease is ushered in or attended with
considerable heat and fever, either during its continuance,
or from the first, the A.A., in doses of twenty drops,
should be alternated with the B.B., at the intervals
mentioned above.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Lumbago</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is merely a form of rheumatism, locating itself
upon the muscles of the loins. It may be mistaken for
some other or different disease, and hence its symptoms
should be known.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—After some exposure, especially to cold or
wet, or a draft of air, the cow will suddenly become lame
in one leg, without other signs to explain the nature of
the attack. Another leg may then be affected, while the
first one seems better or quite well. Some pain and heat
may be discovered in one of the joints; and then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>muscles of the back show more clearly the location of the
disease; or from the first the disease may be referable to
this point; the animal yields and flinches when they are
pressed upon, in consequence of the pain; the beast is
not able to walk, or does so very stiffly and awkwardly,
in consequence of increased pain from movement. These
attacks may continue for a time, disappear and return
again, in consequence of new exposure.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The B.B. should be given, a dose of
twenty drops, three times per day, which follow with J.K.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ophthalmia, Inflammation of the Eye</h4>

<p class='c010'>Diseased and inflamed eyes in cattle may sometimes
occur as a result of congestion, or from inflammation or
a cold, but in general from an injury, the result of a blow
of a whip, or stick, or from dirt or hay seed, or some
similar substance irritating the eye.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The eyelids are swelled and closed; tears
flow in abundance; the eye shrinks from the light when
the lids are opened; the white of the eye or conjunctiva
is reddish or covered with red veins; the haw is also red
and swollen; the eye itself is clouded and covered with a
film.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Examine the eye for dirt, hay seed, or
other substances, and when found remove them. Bathe
the eye with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, diluted
half and half with soft water, morning and night, until
the more violent symptoms are removed. Give, internally,
fifteen drops of A.A. each morning and night.</p>

<p class='c004'>In long standing cases, a dose of I.I., repeated every
few nights, will be found of great value, while the A.A.
is given each morning.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fits, Convulsions, Epilepsy</h4>

<p class='c010'>The symptoms of fits are pretty well known. Without
any or very trifling warning, the beast staggers and falls
suddenly to the ground; he often bellows in the most
alarming manner; then every part of the body is violently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>convulsed; the tail is lashed; the teeth are ground; the
mouth closed, and jaws fastened together; the breathing
is quick and attended with heaving at the flanks; frothy
saliva dribbles from the mouth, and the urine and dung
are discharged involuntarily. In a few moments the
convulsions become less severe, then cease, and the
animal soon seems as well as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fits are most apt to attack young, vigorous, well fed
cattle, or those that have been much exposed to the
direct action of the sun.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Little or nothing can be done during an
attack; but as one is likely to be followed by another,
the medicine should be given as soon as the attack is
well over.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give, immediately after the attack, twenty drops of
the A.A., and repeat the remedy morning and night for
some days.</p>

<p class='c004'>If an animal is subject to these fits (epilepsy), returning
at intervals of a few days or weeks, give, alternately,
at intervals of six or eight days, twenty drops of A.A.,
and J.K., and continue these for some time.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Foul in the Foot, Foot-rot</h4>

<p class='c010'>Usually comes from standing on a filthy floor, but
may follow an injury or tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is lameness and swelling of the pasterns, and
heat, with evident pain; matter then forms, and unless
it is let out, it will extend in all directions under the
foot, and appear at the coronet or top of the hoof; and
from this long, narrow ulcers remain, and proud flesh
springs up from the diseased places.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Place animal in stall with clean dry
bedding. Examine the foot carefully, and remove all
foreign substances, dirt, etc., that may be found; then
foment the foot with hot water, night and morning, and
apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, and wrap it up with a cloth
to keep it clean; the hoof should be pared, and those
parts of it cut away that may interfere with the escape of
matter; all dead hoof must be removed. The sore must
be examined, and if dark and unhealthy, the <span class='sc'>Oil</span> and
covering must be renewed from time to time until the
dark matter sloughs off. After the ulcer looks clean,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>simply apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, over which a cloth
must be kept wrapped around to prevent dirt lodging in
the wound and causing fresh irritation. These may be
renewed, if needful, until entire recovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give also the I.I., each night, a dose of twenty drops.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Mange</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Mange</span> is a disease caused by parasites which live on
the skin of the animal. These parasites are of three kinds:
1. Burrowing mites or Sarcoptes. 2. Sucking mites or
Dermatodectes. 3. Scale eating mites or Symbiotes.
The first class can be seen only with a magnifying glass
but the last two can be seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Sarcoptic Mange</span> is very rare in cattle; the dermatodectic
and symbiotic are the usual forms.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Great itching; so that the animal is continually
rubbing itself, the hair falls off, scabs or sores
remain in patches particularly at the sides and hollow of
the neck and the root of the tail.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Clip the hair around the sore places and
soften scabs by applying oil or glycerine containing 5%
of creolin or lysol. Then apply a thick lather of green
soap and leave on over night. These applications are to
soften and remove the scabs and prepare the skin for the
real remedy. Of these there are many; sulphur ointment
(equal parts flowers of sulphur and lard) is an old standby
or you can use a 3% solution of creolin or lysol. This
should be thoroughly rubbed into the skin by a brush and
kept on for a week reapplying as it becomes rubbed off.
Then wash off and reapply for another week. The reason
for the second application is that while the first will kill
off all the animals, there may be some eggs that are not
killed and if only one application is made after it has
been removed, the eggs may hatch out and the Mange
come back.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hidebound</h4>

<p class='c010'>This condition, in which the skin seems firm, hard and
bound to the parts beneath, is due to some morbid condition
of the system rather than to a disease of the skin
itself. There is most frequently some derangement of
the stomach, or some old standing organic disease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Remove these, and the disease disappears, and the hide
becomes soft and loose.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Giving twenty drops of J.K., morning
and night, will generally remove the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>If it fails after a fair trial, give the J.K., each night,
and twenty drops of I.I., each morning.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Anthrax</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Anthrax</span> is a very contagious disease from which comes
a well known germ, the bacillus anthracis, and which
attacks almost all animals and man. The germ lives
in the animal’s body and also in rich moist soils, and is
very difficult to eradicate. The germ enters the body by
the mouth, in food or water, or through cuts in the skin.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—There is sudden high fever (105 to 107)
the pulse is very frequent (80 to a 100 or more) small and
scarcely perceptible. The mucous membrane of the
head becomes very red, the eyes red, swollen and filled
with tears. The temperature of the body is unequally
distributed, some parts hot, others cold. The animal
does not eat or chew the cud. There is great depression,
weakness, stupor and loss of sensation. There is trembling
over the body, particularly in the hind quarters,
which may even “give way”. Sometimes instead of
stupor, there are attacks of fury, where the animal will
bellow and dash itself against any object it may see.</p>

<p class='c004'>There may or may not be carbuncles, these are small
swellings about the size of a walnut, which may appear
on the head, chest, abdomen, etc., they are blue-black
or dark red in color and are not usually painful.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the most remarkable things about anthrax is its
rapid course, most animals die in from 12 to 48 hours.
After death the bodies do not get stiff and decay very
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This disease is recognized as being incurable,
and generally fatal. In suspected cases, give A.A.,
every two hours, until the animal improves, or the
disease becomes thoroughly developed in which latter case
the animal should be killed at once, the body burned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and the premises disinfected as given under contagious
abortion, page <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Big Jaw—Actinomycosis</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is caused by the Ray fungus which is
sometimes found on barley, oats, cactus, dried grass, etc.,
and which enters the body of the animal through cuts or
wounds on the tongue, gums, etc., and particularly with
young animals at teething time.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—These of course vary with the position of
the wound, through which the fungus entered the body.
If on the tongue, the tongue becomes swollen and very
painful “wooden tongue.” If around the teeth, the jaw
becomes swollen and finally the growth breaks through
the skin or into the mouth. If through the skin of the
head or neck, large nodules appear, varying in size from
a hazel nut to a man’s fist.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The most successful treatment is by
cutting out the nodules; this of course should be done
by a Veterinary Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c004'>We advise calling a Veterinary Surgeon and having
him perform the operation as soon as possible, as the
disease is usually curable if properly handled and it cannot
be transmitted to man or to the other animals.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Texas Fever—Red Water—Black Water—Hemoglobinuria</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is an infection of the blood by small
animals called protozoa which are transmitted by the
cattle tick. Only cattle get this disease although other
animals may have plenty of ticks.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cattle tick spends part of its life on the animal and
part on the ground. The females after having become
pregnant, while on the cattle, drop to the ground and
lay their eggs; when the eggs hatch, the young ticks
crawl to the top of the blades of grass and attach themselves
to the cattle.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>There are two types of this disease, the acute and the
chronic, the acute form usually attacks cattle in hot
weather, while the chronic or mild form is more apt to
be found in the fall.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In the acute form there is fever, great
depression, loss of appetite, and the animal does not
chew the cud. The animal lies down or stands with
arched back. The most characteristic symptom is the
color of the urine; this ranges from pink to black.
Death takes place in from three to four days, generally
preceded by a fall of temperature, or the fever may drop
and the animal recover very slowly. In the chronic or
mild type, there is fever, loss of appetite, the animal
does not chew the cud and may become very thin; but
usually the urine is not discolored. In this type of
the disease the animals usually recover.</p>

<p class='c004'>You should be careful not to mistake Texas Fever for
Anthrax or Black Leg. In Texas Fever the ticks are
always found on the hide, and calves do not have it
while all animals have Anthrax. The membranes are
pale in Texas Fever, but very red in Anthrax. In Black
Leg the animals are from six months to two years old,
older or younger they do not have it; and of course
there are the characteristic swellings.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Prevention is usually more satisfactory
than treatment after the disease has started. However
as the disease is not transmitted to the other animals or
to man, there is no reason for not trying to save the
animal. Give A.A., twenty drops four times a day for
two days, then alternate H.H., with the A.A. Remove
all ticks and place in a tick free enclosure and give
nourishing diet.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prevention.</span>—For small numbers of animals in infested
districts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pick or brush the ticks from the animals three times
per week particularly from belly, legs, tail and udder
from June 1st to November 1st.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Or smear the legs and sides of the cattle twice a week
with Beaumont crude petroleum, or a mixture of 1 gallon
each of cottonseed and kerosene oil (coal oil) containing 1
pound of sulphur, these may be either brushed or
sprayed on from June 1st to November 1st.</p>

<p class='c004'>For large numbers of animals write to the Bureau of
Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C., and ask for Farmers Bulletin
No. 152.</p>

<p class='c004'>To remove ticks from an infested pasture.</p>

<p class='c004'>1. Remove all animals on September 1st and allow no
animals on the pasture until April 1st, or cultivate the
pasture for a year, or burn it over in spring and fall,
and allow no animals with ticks on it.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.—<span class='sc'>Part II.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Choryza, or Cold in the Head</h4>

<p class='c010'>This very common affection consists of an irritation,
and sometimes inflammation of the lining membrane of
the nose. It is usually caused by exposure to cold or
wet, or too sudden changes of weather; it is sometimes
the commencement of catarrh, and is most frequent
during winter and early spring; or it may arise from the
irritation of dust inhaled during a long journey.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In some cases of cold, the irritation is
confined to the nose alone, and is then known as
Choryza. It is manifested by a discharge from the nose,
first thin and watery, afterward becoming thicker, like
matter, and corrosive, fretting the skin.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the disease extends along the air passages, bronchitis,
or even inflammation of the lungs, results, manifested
by the cough, fever and difficulty of breathing peculiar
to these affections.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—For mere choryza or cold in the head,
give twenty drops of C.C., morning and night.</p>

<p class='c004'>If symptoms of Fever, Bronchitis, or Pneumonia should
be present, interpose a few doses of A.A., twenty drops,
repeated every three or four hours, which will promptly
relieve. Consult also what is said on Bronchitis or
Pneumonia.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hoose, Catarrh, or Common Cold</h4>

<p class='c010'>Differs from the Choryza, as the irritation involves the
lining membrane of the entire air passages. It is most
frequent in the changeable weather of spring and fall,
when cattle are exposed to frequent alternations of
temperature, or when too many cows are crowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>together in a stable, rendering the air hot and impure.
Young beasts and cows after calving are especially
subject to hoose.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Dry nose, frequent cough, discharge from
the nostrils, stiffness of the limbs, disinclination to move,
purging, cold skin, and then hot; imperfect chewing of
the cud, failing of milk, watery eyes, quick pulse and
breathing. It is very frequent and very fatal in calves,
and requires to be attended to promptly in all cases, or
it will end in some more dangerous disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—During the earlier stage, with fever,
heat, quick pulse and breathing, give the A.A., a dose
of twenty drops, four times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should cough and irritation remain, or not yield
promptly to the A.A., give the E.E., the same dose,
repeated four times daily; or if fever yet continues, give
the two Remedies in alternation, at intervals of three
hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>For calves, give one-third or half as much as for grown
cattle, according to age or size.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Sore Throat or Pharyngitis</h4>

<p class='c010'>The disease consists of inflammation, with consequent
swelling and soreness of the top of the gullet or passage
between the mouth and stomach. It arises from the
same causes which produce colds, and sometimes assumes
an epidemic and very fatal character, especially when the
spring or fall is very cold and wet and the animals graze
on damp, marshy grounds. It is usually accompanied
with catarrh.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Difficulty of swallowing, so that solid food
is partially chewed and then dropped from the mouth;
fluids are gulped down, or partly return through the
nostrils; or all food may be refused in consequence of the
severe pain attending swallowing; the cud is not chewed;
the throat and glands of the neck are swelled, hot and
painful; the cough is frequent, hoarse, and indicates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>pain; the breathing becomes very difficult and labored,
and the pulse full and quick.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give twenty drops of A.A., every three
or four hours, until three doses have been given, then
begin with the C.C., and give every three hours of the
C.C., in alternation with the A.A. As the animal improves
and the fever and heat abate, the A.A., may be
discontinued, and the C.C., be used alone, at intervals
of four or six hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>In all febrile diseases of cattle, it is of the utmost
importance to house them in a <i>warm</i>, <i>dry</i>, <i>comfortable
stable</i>, free from exposure, dampness, or cold drafts of
air, especially in cold or moist weather.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cough</h4>

<p class='c010'>Cough in the cow is rarely or never a disease of itself,
but merely a symptom or attendant of some disease of
the respiratory organs, such as Catarrh, Bronchitis,
Pleurisy or Pneumonia, of which it is merely the indication.
Its symptomatic importance is such that it always
deserves attention, and its cause should at once be carefully
investigated. In some case very grave alterations
may be going on in the lungs, which will escape notice if
attention be not directed to it by means of the cough.
Examine the animal carefully, ascertain the state of her
pulse, breathing, appetite, secretion of milk, etc., and
direct treatment for such disease as is found to be present.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, in the absence of any special indications, the
E.E., should be given, a dose of twenty drops morning
and night, which will generally relieve, and will not be
out of place in any case.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bronchitis, or Inflammation of the Bronchial Tubes</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is usually the result of exposure to cold
and wet, or sudden changes of temperature; it is almost
always preceded by a common cold, which has been
neglected or overlooked.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Cough, which becomes by degrees more
painful, frequent and husky; the countenance becomes
anxious and distressed; the breathing is quick, heaving
and obstructed, in consequence of tough, tenacious
phlegm; unwillingness to move; the breath is hot; the
cough is increased by moving about, occurs in fits, and
is wheezing in character; no food is eaten; the animal
wastes; skin becomes dry, and is bound to the ribs; the
coat stares and looks unthrifty. The animal may die
from extension of the disease to the substance of the
lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The earlier stages of this disease, or
catarrh, should be treated at once, as directed under that
head. Then a dose or two of the remedy for that disease
removes all danger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Remove the animal to a warm but well ventilated
stable, and feed on warm mashes and gruel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give first, at intervals of two hours, two or three doses
of A.A., twenty drops at a dose. This will allay the heat
and fever to some extent. Then alternate, at intervals
of three hours, the E.E., with the A.A., the same doses,
and continue this treatment until restored, only that the
medicine need not be given so frequently after improvement
has progressed.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pleurisy</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease consists of an inflammation of the delicate
membrane which lines the chest, and also is reflected
over or covers the lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is caused most frequently by exposure to cold, or
from the extension of catarrh. Pleurisy rarely exists
alone, but is almost invariably complicated with bronchitis
or pneumonia, or both.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease generally begins in the same
manner as pneumonia, with dullness, loss of appetite,
etc. The cough is attended with pain, and seems to be
cut short, as if the animal tried to stop it; the breathing
is short, seemingly cut off and evidently painful during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the passage of the air into the lungs, and is attended with
a grunt during its expiration; the sides are painful when
pressed upon; the skin, at the angles of the mouth, is
wrinkled; the shoulders and upper part of the chest are
in a constant quiver; the head is stretched out; the eyes
are unusually bright; the tongue hangs out of the mouth,
from which frothy slaver is continually flowing. The
animal neither eats nor chews the cud; she gets weaker
and thinner every day, and all the symptoms become
more and more severe until death ensues, often preceded
by excessive purging.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give at first the A.A., a dose of twenty
drops, every two hours, and continue this the first day
and night if the case is severe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then alternate the E.E., with the A.A., at intervals of
two, three or four hours.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Food and Stabling.</span>—In all serious diseases of the air-passages,
Bronchitis, Pleurisy, Pneumonia, etc., the
animal should be placed in a dry, comfortable stable,
not too close, and her food should consist of bran mashes,
boiled carrots or turnips, meal-gruel and hay tea. Good
old hay may be given <i>sparingly</i>; straw and chaff not at
all. When the appetite is returning, great care must be
taken not to give too much food at once, for if the stomach
is overloaded or crammed, disease is almost sure to return,
and the animal to die in consequence. <i>Give but very
sparingly of food</i> until the stomach has fully regained its
former power of digestion.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pneumonia, or Inflammation of the Lungs</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is an inflammation of the substance of the lungs,
or lights, and is rarely unaccompanied with pleurisy or
bronchitis. It is usually brought on by exposure to cold
or sudden changes of temperature, or from the extension
of a common cold.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Symptoms</span> are as follows: The cow becomes dull,
disinclined to move, and hangs her head; the muzzle is
dry; the mouth hot; the cough frequent and dry; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>coat rough and staring; the horns, ears and feet are hot
at one time and cold at another; the breathing is
quickened and attended with heaving of the flanks; the
pulse is full and quick; appetite is gone and chewing of
the cud suspended. The thirst is great, bowels bound
and dung dark-colored; the spine is tender when pressed
upon; the head projected forward and eyes staring; tears
flow down the face; the teeth are ground; a discharge
flows from the nose, at first clear and watery, afterwards
red and containing some blood; the breathing becomes
quicker, more difficult, and labored as the disease
advances; the cough comes on in fits; the nostrils are
widened, and play to their utmost limit; the body is
covered with sweat; the pulse becomes weaker and
increased in frequency, and these symptoms increase in
violence and become gradually worse until the animal
dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give, the first twelve or twenty-four
hours, the A.A., a dose of twenty drops, every two
hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the fever and heat have been thus in a measure
subdued, alternate the E.E. with the A.A., at intervals
of three hours, giving as before, twenty drops at a dose.</p>

<p class='c004'>Continue this treatment steadily, except that, unless
the case is very critical and urgent, the medicine need
not to be kept up during the night, but a dose of the E.E.
may be given, late in the night, and be permitted to act
undisturbed until the morning; then go on as before.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bronchitis from Worms</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Calves and yearlings are particularly liable to
the production of parasite worms, of the genus <i>Filaria</i>,
in the bronchial tubes, which are sometimes choked up
with them. They are from one to three inches long, of a
silvery color, and generally invade cattle fed in low,
marshy or woody pasture, where there is little water.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Slight catarrh; cough, at first dry and
husky, then short and paroxysmal; accelerated breathing,
with occasional grunting, and distress in the chest; quick
pulse (100); thin nasal discharge; dullness; wasting. If
these be not relieved, the animal becomes restless,
manifests anxiety, breathes with rapidity, difficulty and
grunting; the ears hang, the nostrils widen, the eyes are
hollow; dyspnœa, debility, and atrophy end in death.
Sometimes there is tolerable health, while the flesh all
wastes away, and nothing is left but skin and bones. A
<i>post-mortem</i> examination shows inflammation and thickening
of the bronchia and lungs, and accumulation of
worms, rolled together with mucous in small balls.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Where there is any doubt of the existence
of worms, treat as for bronchitis. If disease is evidently
from an accumulation of worms in the bronchial tubes,
the inhalation of chloroform is recommended, repeated
at lengthened intervals, according to the circumstances
of the case.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tuberculosis—Consumption</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—This is a serious and almost always a
chronic disease, characterized by the formation of tubercles
in the lungs, glands, intestines, udder, etc., which,
increasing in size and running together, at length
suppurate, and form abscesses in the substance of those
organs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Tuberculosis is caused by the Bacillus Tuberculosis
which is transmitted to a healthy animal by
water, fodder, dust, etc., which has come in contact with
the nasal or uterine discharges of a diseased animal.
However bad ventilation and poor nourished predispose
to the disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Inward, feeble, painful, hoarse, gurgling
cough, especially after exertion; loss of appetite; irregularity
of rumination; disturbance of digestion; emaciation;
loss of hair, especially of the eye-brows;
unthrifty appearance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This disease is recognized as being incurable,
and generally fatal. In suspected cases, give A. A.,
and E.E., every two hours, until the animal improves or
the disease becomes thoroughly developed, in which
latter case the animal should be killed at once.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Treatment.</span>—The animal should be housed
in a stable that is comfortable and airy, but free from
north and east winds, and kept apart from other cattle;
it should never be hurried, excited or alarmed; the litter
should be frequently changed and kept dry, and the
skin frequently rubbed and curry-combed to stimulate
its perspiratory action.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.—<span class='sc'>Part II.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Rumination</h4>

<p class='c010'>Oxen and sheep belong to the class of animals known
as Ruminants, which feed principally on the leaves and
stalks of plants. The quantity of food which they take
at a time is very considerable; with a powerful prehensile
tongue, they rapidly gather up into their mouths thick
and long tufts of grass, which are only slightly masticated,
and immediately swallowed. Four stomachs—so called,
although the fourth stomach is the true stomach,
and the other three are appendages of the œsophagus—are
employed in the process of digestion. The first—the
paunch, or rumen—is by far the larger of the four,
occupying three-fourths of the abdominal cavity. Its
mucous membrane is rough with <i>papillæ</i> or eminences,
and protected with a dense scaly <i>epithelium</i>. The second
is called the recticulum, or honey-comb bag, because the
lining mucous membrane is so disposed in folds as to
form hexagonal spaces; within these spaces the tubes of
the glands may be seen. This bag is the smallest of the
digestive organs, is connected with the anterior part of
the paunch, with which it communicates freely, and to
which, indeed, it may be regarded as dependent. The
third cavity is the <i>manyplies</i>, <i>maniplus</i> or <i>omasum</i>; the
first name being given on account of the many plies or
folds formed by the mucous membrane. These folds are
of unequal breadth, the principal ones being separated
by others, which gradually diminish in size. The surface
is covered with <i>papillæ</i>, the folds being flattened at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>sides and somewhat pointed at the fore edges, forming
ridges and furrows. The contents of the manyplies are
always dry; the food sometimes becomes compressed into
thin cakes between the folds, and the epithelium manifests
a tendency to peel off in shreds and adhere to the
pulpy mass of food. The fourth cavity—the <i>abomasum</i>
or <i>rennet</i>—is the true stomach, discharging the same
functions as the stomachs of those animals that have
only one such organ. It is considerably larger than
either the second or third stomach, although less than
the first; is lined with a thick villous coat, which is contracted
into ridges and furrows, somewhat like the
omasum, and secretes an acid, solvent juice, essential
to the process of chymification. The act of rumination
calls into exercise the first three organs. The crushed
food passes from the œsophagus to the rumen; there it
remains for some time, subject to the action of heat,
saliva, mucous and the secretion of the organ. The
tougher the food the longer it is retained. From the
rumen the food passes to the recticulum, where the
operation of maceration, commenced in the first stomach,
is continued, the operation being facilitated by a slow,
churning movement characteristic of both organs. The
recticulum also appears to be the special receptacle of the
fluid that is swallowed, for this at once passes into it,
without going into the first stomach. The precise nature
of the action of the secretions is uncertain. It is supposed
to be a fermentation; no doubt at all times a certain
proportion of gas is evolved from the food, but excessive
fermentation is indicative of disease (Hoove), and of
rapid and dangerous chemical change in the contents of
the rumen. The pulpy mass, to which the food has been
reduced by the chemical change and churning movement
of the first two digestive cavities, is now prepared for
thorough mastication by the teeth, and for ultimate
solution by the digestive fluids. This mastication is
<i>rumination</i>, or “chewing the cud.” The return of the
food to the mouth for this operation is effected by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>churning movement and by the contraction of the diaphragm
and abdominal muscles, which press upward
against the rumen and recticulum. The act of regurgitation
is very evident to an observer, who sees a large mass
ascend from the paunch and distend the œsophagus with
an eructating noise. At the moment that a mass of the
food passes into the mouth, the accompanying liquid is
swallowed into the first of the three stomachs, leaving
the solid portion to be slowly ground by the teeth. The
length of time thus taken varies with the toughness of
the food. Young and very old animals take longer to
chew the cud than healthy adults. When the food has
been sufficiently comminuted it is again swallowed, some
of it into the first two stomachs; but, by a peculiar
mechanism of muscular contraction; the passage into the
first is so closed that the greater portion of it passes
through the opening into the third stomach, from which
it goes into the abomasum. The function of the omasum
appears to be to regulate the descent of food into the
abomasum, though some means of assimilation may take
place between its many plies. The last stomach, as
already stated, completes the process of digestion.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Loss of the Cud</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a mere symptom which accompanies many
diseases, and even morbid conditions, which scarcely
deserve the name of disease, and will yield with the
removal of the ailment of which it is a mere symptom.
Sometimes it may be present when nothing else is
sufficiently tangible to warrant treatment, or it may
continue after the disease otherwise seems to have been
removed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In any case in which it appears to exist
independently, or to be the principal symptom, give
twenty drops of the J. K., morning and night, The
“cud” will soon return.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Colic</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease is not so dangerous as tympanitis, yet it
may prove fatal from bad treatment or neglect. It is
generally the result of improper or indigestible food, or
food in too great quantity, or that to which the animal
is not accustomed. If colic comes on after indigestible
food, it is accompanied by constipation and thirst.
Certain kinds of food, such as grains, oats, decayed
turnips or cabbages, or dry food, are liable to induce it,
or it may arise from exposure to cold when the body is
warm, or from cold drinking when the body is heated.</p>

<p class='c004'>It consists in severe paroxysms of pain in the bowels,
and, if neglected, is liable to cause inflammatory disease
of the digestive organs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Sudden manifestation of pain in the belly,
by uneasiness, pawing the ground, striking the belly
with the hind legs or horns, often lying down and then
rising, grinding the teeth, and moaning. When caused
by wind, the belly is much swelled on the left side, and
there is frequent passage of flatus. The animal’s back
is arched, and she frequently looks at her flanks, scrapes
with her fore feet, and kicks with the hind ones. All
these symptoms increase, until she expires amid groans
and grinding of the teeth. Or the following may be
noticed:</p>

<p class='c004'>The animal refuses to eat, looks to its sides, paws the
ground, kicks against the body with the hind feet, lies
down, rises again, and continues these movements till
unable longer to keep upon its feet. Often the animal
falls down so violently that it seems as though the four
legs were suddenly struck away from under it, or he
squats down like a dog upon his hind quarters, rolls over,
lies upon his back for a time, with the legs stretched
upward, and generally acts as if frantic. The horns,
ears and feet are alternately hot and cold. The animal
suffers from thirst and constipation, the longer the constipation
the more acute the pain; the paunch is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>swollen. If recovery takes place, the symptoms are
gradually mitigated, and then entirely disappear. On
the other hand, if the pains get worse and become more
frequent, the bowels become inflamed, and if the pains,
under these circumstances, suddenly disappear, the
inflammation terminates in <i>gangrene</i> (mortification), and
the animal dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The F. F., will almost invariably be found
successful. Give a dose of twenty drops every half hour
until relieved. If not better after a few doses, and should
there be fever, alternate the A. A., the same dose, with
the F. F., at the same intervals. As the animal seems
relieved, or partially so, give the remedies at longer
intervals.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Constipation</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is rarely of grave consequence in cattle, and when
it exists, is usually a symptom of some other disease.
When present, a dose of twenty drops of the J. K., given
morning and night, will soon set all right again. If
there is suspicion of some inflammatory condition lurking
in the system, the A. A., in like doses, will have the
like effect.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tympanitis—Hoove—Blown—Drum-Belly—Grain-Sick—Heaving of the Flanks—Maw Bound</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disorder—of very frequent occurrence among
cattle, though not belonging exclusively to them—is of
two kinds; one due to the evolution of gas from the food
taken, the other to the impaction of the food. In one
case the gas produces enormous inflation of the rumen,
or first of the four stomachs possessed by cattle, in the
other distension.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis.</span>—To Mr. Surmon we are indebted for the
following table of</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—When cattle, especially such as have had
poor and scanty food, are turned into a rich pasture, or
stray into the fields of lucern, etc., they will often eat
ravenously, and take more than they can digest. Wet
grass in warm weather, or fodder that has become heated
in consequence of being heaped together while damp,
may also be too freely eaten. The consequence is that
the rumen is overloaded, and the contents, under the
influence of warmth and moisture, ferment and evolve
what is at first carburetted hydrogen; and subsequently
sulphuretted hydrogen; or, if there be no formation of
gas, the food remains solid and undigested. Drinking
excessively of cold water, eating too much bran, chaff,
unboiled potatoes, uncrushed oats, grains, boiled roots
or turnips, may cause the same condition.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—These may appear suddenly, but always
soon after the animal has been feeding, generally on
returning from the field; they may, however, occur in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the stable. The animal ceases to eat or ruminate, is
swollen or “blown” over the whole belly, but particularly
at the flanks or left side, where the distended stomach
lies. The rumen is enormously swollen, the pillars of
the œsophagus are tightly closed, thus preventing the
escape of gas; and the greater the distention the firmer
is the closure of the œsophagus. The swelling yields
when pressed by the finger, and gives forth a hollow
sound, like that from a drum when it is struck. There
are also sour and noisy belchings of wind; the cow does
not move, moans, and is evidently in great distress.
The distended rumen presses on the diaphragm and
impedes the action of the heart and lungs, causing shortness
and difficulty of breathing; the nostrils are widely
dilated, and there is a threatening of suffocation. As
the disease advances, the pulse becomes hard, full, and
quicker than before; the eyes are bloodshot, glazed,
fixed and prominent; the mouth is hot and full to
dripping of frothy slaver; the tongue hangs out; the
veins of the neck and chest are distended with blood;
the poor beast crouches, with its back bent up; the legs
are drawn under the body; the tail is curved upward;
the anus, which is closed, protrudes. The body is now
covered with cold sweat; the animal stands in one place,
continually moans or grunts, trembles, totters, falls,
struggles violently, ejects from mouth and nose sour
fluid mixed with solid food, and at length sinks and dies,
either from suffocation or rupture of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This is the same whether the distention
is from gas or impacted food. F.F. may be given a dose
every quarter or half hour. We give the method of
puncturing, which, however, need never be resorted to
if the F.F. be administered.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Puncturing.</i>—Relief is sometimes very urgently required,
and this is best afforded either by plunging a trocar into
the left side, or by passing a probang down the œsophagus
into the paunch. If the trocar is used, let the canula of
the instrument be ten or twelve inches long, so as to
prevent the paunch from slipping away from the canula
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and causing delay, and perhaps further danger. <i>Chloride
of Lime</i> is valuable after the animal is somewhat relieved
by the use of the trocar; about two drachms should be
mixed with a quart of water. In case of immediate relief
being imperative, and a trocar not being at hand, a long,
sharp pointed pen-knife may be used for puncturing.
The place for puncturing is midway between the hip and
ribs, where the distended rumen is prominent; the
direction is inward and downward. The puncture will
be followed by an outrush of gas, fluid, and even portions
of food. A quill, or some other tube, must be ready to be
inserted in the hole immediately after the knife is withdrawn,
otherwise the wound will close. If nothing
tubular be at hand, a smooth piece of stick must be put
in, or anything else that will serve the purpose of keeping
open the wound till the gas has escaped. The danger of
this operation is not from the wound itself, but from the
escape of the contents of the paunch into the abdomen,
which would cause peritonitis, or from piercing the
spleen or kidney. The operation can only be regarded
as a rough one, to be adopted in case of great emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>When distension has ceased and matters have to some
extent resumed their ordinary course, the animal should
remain some hours without food or water. The food
afterwards should be sparing and suitable.</p>

<p class='c004'>J. K., should be administered two or three times daily
until the animal is fully recovered.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diarrhea, Scouring</h4>

<p class='c010'>Diarrhea is more common in old cattle and calves
than in those of middle age, where it is generally of little
importance, soon correcting itself, especially in the spring,
when herds are first turned into green fields. The usual
causes are: decayed cabbages, bad grains, or other improper
food, or impure water; sudden change to rich
pastures; the use of purgative medicines; exposure to
cold and wet, acrid bile, sudden change from dry to wet
weather, or severe exertion in hot, dry weather.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease comes on slowly, with staring
coat, shaking, arched back, fore legs drawn together,
cold legs, ears and horns, weak pulse, tucked up belly,
bowels rather looser than usual, deficient appetite. The
animal becomes thinner, more depressed and dull; little
or no milk is given, and the bowels are purged to an
alarming extent. This purging may stop and then reappear
to end fatally, or terminate in dysentery.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—We should, of course, give food not so
loosening in its character and the F.F., a dose of twenty
drops two or three times per day, will usually be found
quite sufficient. In extreme cases, or in case of failure
with this remedy, the I.I., may be alternated with it,
at the same or even more frequent intervals.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diarrhea or Cholera or “Skitt” in Young Calves</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is quite common, and not unfrequently dangerous. In
its more dangerous form it appears the first or second
day, and it is then presumably caused by the feverish or
unhealthy condition of the mother’s milk. In its natural
condition, this first milk is laxative and intended to act
as a removal of the first passages in the new born calf.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the milk is very rich in butter, as in the Jersey
cattle, it becomes excessively laxative, especially during
the period of the milk fever, or the first three days after
calving. The passages are noticed to be very frequent,
loose, liquid, or even watery, with weakness and rapid
wasting; the legs and ears become cold, and, in extreme
cases, short breath and panting with the tongue out.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The dam should always have a dose of
A.A., soon after calving, and this should be continued,
a dose at least three times per day for four days, or until
the usual danger from milk fever is passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, however, the dam has had no treatment, give her
a dose alternately of the A.A., and of the F.F., at
intervals of three hours, to change the feverish or unhealthy
nature of the milk, as well as to give the calf
the Remedy through the mother’s milk.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Give also to the calf a dose of five drops of F.F., once
in three hours if the case is urgent, or three times per
day if but slight, and gradually omit as the calf improves.
If the F.F., fails, give I.I., a dose every fifteen minutes
or half hour at first until relieved, then once in three
hours.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dysentery—Johnes Disease</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a disease which has existed on certain farms
for years without either the owners or Veterinarians
knowing what it was, and it is only within the last few
years that we have known that it was caused by a
definite disease germ.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—This disease usually attacks whole herds
rather than individual animals. At first there is loss of
condition and weight with rough coat and dry skin,
then diarrhea is noticed, the discharges being brown and
like molasses. There is no fever, but the animal has
little appetite and keeps getting thinner and weaker all
the time until it finally dies from exhaustion. The
course of the disease is long—from two months to three
years—and is always fatal.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In suspected cases give F.F., twenty
drops every three hours, until the animal improves or
the disease becomes thoroughly developed in which latter
case the animal should be killed at once, and the place
disinfected as given under abortion on page <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Stomatitis</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of
the lips, cheeks and gums and occasionally also of the
palate and tongue. It may occur as one of the symptoms
of a disease of the digestive organs or general disease; or
may be caused by thorns, sharp teeth, rough food,
poisonous plants, mercury, fungi, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The membrane of the mouth is red and
inflamed and the animal does not eat because of the pain
in chewing. In some forms of this disease there are also
swellings and tenderness about the pasterns and cracks
and scars on the udder and teats, which makes the disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>look very much like foot and mouth disease. However
in foot and mouth disease, the whole herd and
also hogs and sheep are attacked, while with stomatitis
only a few cattle are affected.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give C.C., in the morning, and I.I., at
night, also wash the mouth with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel
Witch Hazel</span> and water half and half. Give plenty of
clean pure water, and only soft or liquid food, such as
gruels, mashes, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is also a form of this disease which attacks
calves (calf diphtheria) usually under six weeks old. The
mouth is covered with yellow-gray patches and there is
high fever, swelled glands about the throat, and great
weakness. The treatment is the same as given above,
except that as the disease is contagious, the calf must be
separated from the other animals and everything that it
has come in contact with disinfected.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Boulimia—Excessive Appetite</h4>

<p class='c010'>An unusual increase of appetite is a symptom of a
morbid state of the constitution. Though the animal
eats largely, greedily, and even shows a disposition for
uncommon food, which he takes gluttonously, he may
become more and more emaciated. Suitable food should
be given; at the same time it should be fresh, and not in
excessive quantities, although there is a desire for it.
Fresh, cold water should also be given.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Impaction of the Omasum Fardel Bound—Dry Murrain</h4>

<p class='c010'>The first three stomachs of ruminants do not secrete
fluids and are dependent for their action on saliva and
swallowed liquids. Hence if an animal has not had
sufficient water or a fever has dried up the saliva, the
food may become dry and caked in the folds of the third
stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—There is loss of cud and appetite, the
right flank is full and hard on pressure. In slight cases
the animal may remain standing, but usually is lying on
the left side with nose against the right flank. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>constipation alternating with diarrhea. The legs and
horns are cold and the coat “hide bound.” These are
the usual symptoms, but sometimes the animal becomes
frantic, and rising rushes blindly about often doing
itself considerable damage.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A.A., and J.K., alternately every
two hours. In addition to this give a plentiful supply of
liquids, such as linseed tea, 2 to 3 buckets daily; also
enemas of warm water with a little salt are often helpful.
During convalescence the diet should consist of sloppy
food with plenty of water and salt.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Irregular Teeth</h4>

<p class='c010'>May be looked for if an animal presents the following
symptoms: The beast becoming thinner gradually, and
eating less food than usual; slaver dribbling from the
mouth along with half-chewed food, especially while the
cow is cudding; she is “hoven” or bloated at different
times; a bad smell comes from the mouth, arising from
ulceration of the side of the cheek, caused by irregular
teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The mouth must be carefully examined,
and all long or irregular teeth must be shortened and
smoothed by means of the tooth-rasp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gastritis—Gast
ro-Enteritis—Inflammation
of the Stomach</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Gastritis is inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the abomasum, extending, generally, into
the duodenum (gastro-enteritis). It is not of unfrequent
occurrence, and usually accompanies enteritis. (See next
section). It is a very dangerous disease, and frequently
terminates fatally.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—They are the same as those of enteritis—improper
food, musty hay, acrid plants, impure water, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The beast is heavy, dejected, restless,
scrapes the ground with the fore feet, strikes the belly
with the hind feet, grinds the teeth, looks around at its
flanks and belly, groans, lows; the look is sad, the eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>red; the ears, horns and feet cold; the muzzle dry; the
abdomen somewhat swollen and extremely tender; there
is diarrhea and vomiting, and cessation or deterioration
of milk, which, when drawn, is thin, yellowish, stringy,
and irritates the udder; sometimes it is reddish and
offensive. Spasms and colic are occasionally so intense as
to make the animal furious. M. Gelle has observed that
the most constant symptoms of gastritis are: loss of
appetite, arrest of rumination, and abnormal condition
of the tongue. If the inflammation be intense, the
tongue appears to be contracted, straighter and more
rounded than usual, red at the point and along the
edges, and the papillæ are elevated and injected. In
some intense cases, when several of the viscera are involved,
the tongue is yellow or green.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A.A., is the first and principal remedy,
and may be given, at first, a dose every half hour or
hour. As the animal improves, the intervals between
the doses may be prolonged, and only at the conclusion,
when the animal has become free from the more active
symptoms, or they have subsided, the J.K., may be
given for the remaining debility of the digestive organs.</p>

<p class='c004'>No solid food should be given until convalescence sets
in. Small quantities of fluids may be given in the form
of oatmeal or flour gruel, or water.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Enteritis—Inflammation of the Bowels</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Inflammation of the intestines, throughout
a greater or less extent of their course, and involving
all the coats of the intestines or only the mucous lining.</p>

<p class='c004'>It generally attacks cattle of middle age and robust
health; sometimes appears as an epidemic in certain
districts, and seems to be most prevalent in hot summers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Sudden exposure to cold, or drinking cold
water when heated; eating acrid or unwholesome plants;
mildewed food; too stimulating diet; drinking impure
water; sudden change from poor to rich food; colds,
injuries inflicted on the abdomen, the presence of a
large number of worms in the intestines; badly managed
colic, continuing more than twenty hours, and ending in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>enteritis; animals inflicted with colic may so injure themselves
by falling or rolling over that this complaint may
be the consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Shivering, dullness, extreme restlessness;
frequent lying down and rising again, with signs of pain
in the bowels; hard, small and rapid pulse; quickened
breathing; hot mouth and violent thirst; red and protruding
eyes; pawing and kicking; frequent efforts to
urinate, but no water, or only a few drops, are discharged;
the pain, which is most intense and constant, is increased
by pressure and moving about. The hair is rough, the
loins tender, the abdomen swollen on the left side, and
incapable of bearing pressure; the bowels are obstinately
confined; the fæces hard and glazed with slime; but
occasionally liquid dung is forced with dreadful agony
through the hardened mass obstructing the lower bowel,
and all previous symptoms become aggravated. If the
latter disease lasts a few days, and there is a sudden
cessation of pain, this is a sign that <i>gangrene</i> (mortification)
has set in; the feet and ears become quite cold, and
after a while the animal falls heavily, struggles convulsively
for a brief period, and dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis.</span>—As the symptoms of this violent complaint
resemble, in many respects, those of colic, it may be
well to point out the distinctions between the one and
the other.</p>

</table>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A.A., should be given at first, a dose
every fifteen minutes, and after an hour, a dose every
thirty minutes, and after three or four hours, a dose
once an hour, which should be continued until the
disease yields; only should there be considerable gas or
bloating, or extreme pain, a dose or two of F.F., may
be interposed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Hot water is a valuable adjunct in
the treatment of the disease. It may be applied externally
by steeping cloths in the water, and closely and
compactly, but not too tightly applying them to the body
and securing them by belts. Hot water may also be
given, either as a drench or as an injection. The water
must not be so hot as to scald the animal. The administration
of A.A., as stated above, and hot water applied
copiously to the body of the animal locally, and occasionally
in doses of from a half-pint to a pint internally, will
constitute the principal features of the treatment at the
commencement of an attack. If applications of hot
water are used, the animal should be afterwards rubbed
dry and well covered with suitable dry cloths.</p>

<p class='c004'>If discovered in time, an inflammation of the digestive
organs will generally yield to the prompt use of the
above remedies. Linseed tea, or oatmeal gruel, will
form the most suitable diet.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Peritonitis—Inflammation of the Peritoneum</h4>

<p class='c010'>Inflammation of the membrane which invests the
abdominal viscera is very similar to enteritis. It is
rapid in its course, generally ending fatally in six or
eight days.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Lesions, contusions, and wounds of the walls
of the abdomen; surgical operations, castration, sudden
cold, infection while calving.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Inflammatory fever; the animal shows
great sensitiveness when the abdomen is touched, shrinking
when any one approaches it, or flexing the painful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>part when it is touched; looks around at the seat of pain;
generally there is swelling of the belly and tightness
about the flanks. The beast rarely lies down, or, if it
attempts it, rolls on its back; when standing, it keeps
the extremities near the centre of gravity, and bends the
back downward. The abdomen is hot, the ears and hoofs
cold; the pulse rapid, short and wiry. The termination
may be in acute ascites, in adhesions of the peritoneum,
or in gangrene, the latter being recognized by sudden
cessation of pain, small, weak and intermittent pulse,
and rapid prostration.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The cause of the infection must first
be removed, and this may require the assistance of
a Veterinarian. A. A. is the proper medicine and should
be given fifteen drops every half hour as long as there is
any hope of a favorable termination. It will do all the
good that any medicine can do.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Flukes, or Rottenness</h4>

<p class='c010'>This term is applied to the condition caused by the
presence of fluke worms in the liver or bile ducts, where
they sometimes exist in large numbers, causing great
swelling of the liver.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—The disease is chiefly developed in low districts,
and after damp seasons. The worms are taken in with
the food and developed in the liver.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Depression, sadness, inertness, loss of
appetite; watery, red, yellowish, purulent eyes; yellowish
tint of all parts not covered with hair; fœtid smell of
nose and mouth; hard skin; dull, erect hair; irregularity
of excrement, which is white, watery and fœtid.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The principal remedies are A. A., at first,
and then, after a day, alternate C. C., with the A. A., a
dose once in three or four hours.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.—<span class='sc'>Part II.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE URINARY AND REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Suppressed or Scanty Urination</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is usually the result of some disease of the
kidneys, or a mere symptom of other morbid condition,
or it may arise from a paralytic condition of the bladder
itself. This condition will generally be promptly relieved
by giving a few doses of H. H., twenty drops, at
intervals of four, six or twelve hours, according to the
urgency of the case.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Kidneys, Nephritis</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease has many symptoms in common with
cystitis, or inflammation of the bladder, and its treatment
scarcely differs. It occasionally occurs in cattle,
and may be excited by blows upon the loins, calculi, or
small stones formed in the kidneys, or by eating poisonous
plants, or the use of strong allopathic medicines.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The animal brings the fore legs together,
bends the back downward, and presses with pain when
endeavoring to pass water; the loins are hot, more so
than the remainder of the body, sometimes even burning.
The rectum is hot, dung scanty and passed with
pain. There is a great desire to pass water, but only a
few drops escape, which is at first limpid, then thick,
and of a deep red color. The gait is stiff, appetite gone,
no rumination, but great thirst.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give H. H., a dose of twenty drops,
every two, three or four hours, according to the intensity
of the disease.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Bladder, Cystitis</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease is not so common in cattle as in horses,
but may be occasioned by cold or injuries in the region
of the loins. It is manifested by the following.—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The animal constantly keeps the back
arched; the walk is stiff, and the animal, when standing,
leans against something on one side or the other; frequent
effort to pass water, but to little purpose, as only
a small quantity, of deep red color, is passed at a time.
The bowels are bound, evacuations scanty and passed
with pain. There is no appetite or rumination, but
intense thirst; the eyes are prominent, and the countenance
evinces great distress.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The H.H., will be found perfectly appropriate,
and may be repeated, in doses of twenty drops,
every three or four hours, until entire relief is experienced.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hematuria—Discharge of Blood with the Urine</h4>

<p class='c010'>The discharge of blood with the urine is more apt to
be a symptom of some other disease, such as Inflammation
of the Kidneys or Bladder, or Texas Fever, than
to be a disease in itself, although it may occur as such.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Hematuria usually attacks cattle at pasture
on low marshy land. At first the quantity of blood is
small, but it gradually increases, and it often forms clots
which stop up the passages, causing retention of urine
and even bursting of the bladder. The animal grows
weak and pale, and sometimes drops of blood are seen on
the hairs around the opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>In some cases the animal appears to recover, but in
a little while another attack occurs. The disease usually
ends fatally, but only after about two years.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Although this disease is usually fatal, it
is not known to be contagious; therefore we advise making
every effort to save the animal. Give H.H., twenty
drops every four hours at first, and as the disease
mends, night and morning.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Parturition</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The natural period of gestation is about nine calendar
months, or from 270 to 285 days. For a month or three
weeks before the time of calving—or, if poorly in condition,
two months—the cow should be allowed to dry;
otherwise the unnourished calf will be of little value
when it is born. If the cow be milked too long, there is
also danger of bringing down the new milk and causing
puerperal fever, or inflammation of the udder. On the
other hand, a cow should not be fed too high. For some
weeks, as the time approaches, the food should be limited
in quantity, and be given more frequently, otherwise the
rumen will be so distended with food or gas as to press
upon the uterus, alter the position of the fetus, and thus
render parturition difficult.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cows, when well attended to, calve very easily and
require little assistance. For a few days there is a
mucous discharge from the vagina; the animal is restless
and uneasy; groans, and breathes more quickly; the
udder rapidly enlarges; the abdomen drops. The cow
should be allowed to be quiet; it is a cruel and dangerous
practice to rouse and drive her about. The restlessness
soon increases; the cow keeps getting up and lying down;
at last she remains on the ground, and, if all goes well,
the calf is soon born. The expulsive pains cause the
exit of a considerable quantity of fluid, or of a pouch full
of serum. When this pouch bursts, the pains increase
and the calf is expelled. If there be any difficulty, the
fetus may be drawn forward during a pain. The cord
breaks of itself, at some distance from the umbilicus.
The <i>afterbirth</i>, <i>cleansing</i>, or <i>placenta</i>, is not always passed
at once; it may remain for several hours partly or wholly
within the womb, causing some danger of fatal consequences;
but manual interference should not be allowed
till the action of medicines has been found ineffectual for
its removal.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The general treatment has been sufficiently
indicated in the foregoing. If the labor be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>tedious, a dose of A.A., will often help. After two
hours, another dose might be given; and in some
extreme cases, when the pains have nearly ceased, a
dose of the G.G.; will often help.</p>

<p class='c004'>The animal should be kept in a roomy, well-aired
place, free from superfluous litter, covered immediately
after calving if the least danger be apprehended; fed
sparingly for some days, principally on mashes and small
quantities of hay.</p>

<p class='c004'>The udder should be frequently and well stripped of
its contents.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Failure to come in Heat—Sterility</h4>

<p class='c010'>Failure to breed in the cow may occur in two different
forms—first impotence, in which the cow fails to come in
heat, and second, true sterility, in which, although she
came in heat and was bred the service proved unfruitful.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first of these cases may be due to some malformation
of the sexual organs in which case it is incurable;
but it is more often due to insufficient or over-feed, or
lack of exercise, or over-work, or some depressing disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Correct the exercise and feeding, and give
G.G., every night for a week, or, if the case is urgent, a
dose morning and night, and then a dose daily until the
result is manifest.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>True Sterility</span> may also be caused by malformations
and be incurable, but is more often caused by other
things such as a catarrhal condition of the vagina—Leucorrhea
or to ardent heat, or insufficient food, or
debility from disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Treatment</span> for Leucorrhea or a catarrhal condition
of the organs, which may be known by a constant or
frequent discharge from the vagina, give G.G., each
morning and J.K., at night, and continue this for several
weeks, or until she is again served.</p>

<p class='c004'>In addition dissolve one cake of fresh compressed yeast
in a pint of tepid water, then after a few hours, add
another pint. Then wash the vagina well with soap and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>water and use the dissolved yeast as a douche, this should
be done daily for several days.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where there is an excess of excitement, too ardent or
too frequent, or even constant heat, give at first, H.H., a
dose morning and night, for two or three weeks, then a
dose or two of G.G., and the result will usually be
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where there is unthriftiness or want of good condition,
correct the feeding and give G.G., morning and J.K., at
night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cleaning after Calving</h4>

<p class='c010'>In some cases, from torpidity of the calf-bed, the
afterbirth is retained, which may result in very serious
consequences.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dose of twenty drops of G.G., will soon cause its
expulsion and the healthy cleaning of the animal. It
may be repeated, at intervals of four hours, if necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Flooding after Calving</h4>

<p class='c010'>Some blood is necessarily lost after calving, and it is
only when the amount is excessive or continues some
time, or threatens to weaken or destroy the animal, that
the term flooding can be applied to it. It may be
occasioned by injuries received during the process of
delivery, or from the calf-bed not sufficiently contracting
from atony or want of vigor or that organ.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms need not be described; any continuous
flowing from the bearing, before or after delivery, and
especially after the passage of the cleansing, should
receive medication.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The cow should be kept quiet and be
permitted to lie down, and twenty drops of the G.G., be
given every hour, or even every half hour, in urgent
cases.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cold injections, cold, wet cloths, applied to the loins,
or cold water poured upon the belly, are not necessary,
and are not without danger.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Sore Teats</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The teats crack into sores, which become painful, and
discharge, the contents mingling with the milk; the pain
occasioned during milking renders the cow restive, and
soon tends to make her vicious and to keep back her
milk; garget, hence, is apt to arise from the milk
remaining in the udder and causing irritation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span> is sovereign
for <span class='sc'>Sore Teats</span>. In bad cases, wash the teats carefully with
warm water; and after drying with a soft cloth, apply
the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, which repeat morning and night,
simply oiling the sore places or cracks. Give also I.I.,
morning and night; and after three or four days the
J.K., unless indeed the trouble has not been quite cured
by the use of the I.I., and the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Garget, or Inflammation of the Udder</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is most liable to arise after the first calving, and
may be traced to exposure to cold and damp, especially
if the cow is in good condition, or from not milking the
cow clean, so that the milk remains and causes irritation,
or, in some cases, the bag may be wounded by lying
upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—A portion of the bag becomes hot, painful
and swollen; then hard lumps or “cakes” can be felt in
the teats, or in one portion of the bag; other parts of it
become affected in the same way; the pulse is full, quick
and hard; breathing is quickened; the mouth and horns
hot; bowels bound, and other symptoms of fever are
present. If the disease is allowed to go on, the fever
becomes more severe; the cow does not eat or chew the
cud; the swelling, previously hard, becomes soft from
the formation of matter; the milk becomes mixed with
matter, and, in some cases, with blood. If the disease is
not arrested or matter is not let out, it will spread, making
its way slowly to the skin, through which it at last
bursts, leaving deep, long ulcers, which heal with difficulty,
and in many cases a portion of the udder is lost,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>as regards its power to produce milk. If this result is
avoided by judicious treatment, some hardness may
remain, which requires time to remove.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Keep the udder well milked out, and
give the A.A., in alternation with C.C., and apply
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>. This will generally disperse
the heat, hardness and inflammation. But should
suppuration have come on, and the abscess point showing
a soft spot, lance it, and continue C.C., and <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span>, morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dropping after Calving—Milk Fever—Puerperal Fever</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is of frequent occurrence and quite liable
to be fatal, unless under proper homeopathic treatment.
It is much more prevalent some seasons than others,
owing, doubtless, to peculiar atmospheric conditions, and
is more malignant some seasons than others.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are certain causes which predispose to this disease;
thus fat; stall-fed cows are more liable to it than
poor or lean ones; the complaint is more common in the
variable weather of early spring and late fall; a cow once
having the disease is more liable to a return than others.
The exciting causes are: exposure to cold and wet;
driving the cow a long journey too soon; giving too much
or too rich food soon after calving.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—This fever usually begins shortly after
calving, usually within twenty-four hours; if three or
four days pass over, the cow may be considered safe from
an attack. The earlier symptoms are: the cow refuses
her food or only eats a little of it; she is depressed, hangs
her head and looks dull; the horns are hot; the nose,
instead of being damp with healthy dew, becomes hot
and dry; the urine is scanty; the bowels are confined, or,
if moved, the dung is hard and lumpy; the pulse is
quicker and fuller than in health; the breathing is
quickened and attended with heaving at the flanks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>To these warning symptoms are added, with more or
less rapidity, the more formidable ones, which are often
first to attract the attention of the owner. The milk is
reduced in quantity or entirely stopped; the eyes glisten
and look bright and staring; the white of the eye is
covered with numerous red streaks, or is of a leaden
color; the eye-balls are thrust forward in their sockets,
and give the cow a somewhat wild and anxious expression;
the hind legs seem weak, and are separated a little from
each other; she appears to stand uneasily upon them,
resting for a time on one foot and then changing to the
other; this paddling and shifting from one leg to another
continues as the difficulty of standing increases, until the
animal supports herself by leaning against the stall; she
does not chew the cud; all discharge from the bearing
is stopped; the calf is neglected; the pulse becomes
slower than before, and the breathing more difficult; the
udder is hard and swelled, and little or no milk can be
drawn from it; gradually becoming worse, the weakness
in the hind legs increases, so they can no longer support
her; she staggers and sways about, falling, at length,
heavily on the ground; she struggles, tries to rise again,
and may or may not succeed, but in either case soon
loses the power of rising, and lies helpless upon the
ground. In this stage of the complaint the symptoms
vary. In some cases we have the following: The cow
tosses her head from side to side, writhes her body and
lashes her tail, struggles, stretches out her hind legs,
moans and bellows, and seems to suffer great pain. The
breathing is also difficult and labored; the skin covered
with clammy sweat; the paunch enormously swollen from
accumulated gas. Unless this swelling subsides, the
breathing becomes more difficult and labored; the pulse
more rapid and oppressed, so as scarcely to be counted;
the legs very cold; pain is worse; fetid gas rises from the
stomach, and death ensues.</p>

<p class='c004'>In other cases the foregoing symptoms are absent, or
exist only in a slight degree; and we have the following:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The cow lies stretched out at full length on her side, or
her head is brought to the opposite side, with the nose
towards the shoulder and the chin on the ground; or the
head is twisted directly backward, with the nose held out
and the horns upon the shoulder, in the most awkward
manner. The eyes are dim and glassy; the pupils are
dilated, rounded, and do not contract at the approach of
light; the ears drop; the mouth is partly open; the lower
jaw drops if the head is raised; she has not the power to
hold up her head; she has lost the sense of feeling, and
can scarcely swallow, if at all; difficult, rattling breathing;
pulse weak, slow and intermittent, or even imperceptible;
horns, legs and surface cold and chilly; swelling
of the belly increases; udder swelled, hard and sometimes
red on the outside; in some cases dung and urine
suppressed. All these symptoms become worse by degrees,
and unless relieved, death ensues generally within
two days from the attack, sometimes in a few hours.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The symptoms of this disease appear so
suddenly, and run so rapid a course, that if the disease is
prevailing, or there is reason from any cause to apprehend
it, the cow should be watched about the time of calving,
and a dose or two, of fifteen drops, of A.A., should be
given soon after. This will act as a preventive, and
arrest any premonitions of the disease, and we would
counsel its continuance; at least an occasional dose,
morning and night, for two or three days. It will favor
the early and feverless production of milk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should the disease have made its appearance with
evident fever, unequal warmth, bloating, suppressed
discharge from the bearing, etc., give A.A., a dose of
twenty drops, every two or three hours, until the disease
is arrested.</p>

<p class='c004'>Only in the last extremity, with labored breathing,
extreme bloating, and entire loss or rapid failure of
strength, the I.I., may be alternated with the A.A., at
intervals of two hours, in doses of twenty drops, until
the system rallies, when the two medicines may be continued
at longer intervals.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span><span class='sc'>Nursing and Care.</span>—The cow should be placed in a
clean, roomy stall, so as to be allowed to rise and to be
attended with facility; laid on clean, dry straw, no dung
allowed to remain, and be comfortably clothed, according
to the season. The milk should be frequently drawn
off and the udder hand rubbed. She should be with the
fore part of her body higher than the hinder part, or on
a level, with her legs under her in a natural position.
She must be on her side and supported by bundles of
straw, and on no account be allowed to lie out full
stretched, in which position she will become worse and
surely die. Small quantities of warm gruel are best for
food.</p>

<p class='c004'>There have lately come into vogue “Milk Fever Outfits”
by means of which the udder is filled with sterilized
air. While there can be no objection to this treatment
either alone or in conjunction with the A.A. In our
experience the A.A. alone is quite sufficient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Abortion</h4>

<p class='c010'>Abortion or premature birth may occur from three
different causes:</p>

<p class='c004'>1—<span class='sc'>Accidental Abortion.</span>—Caused by a blow; strain;
slipping on a wet floor, over-strain from pulling a heavy
load, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—<span class='sc'>Enzootic Abortion.</span>—Due to some infectious disease
of the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—<span class='sc'>Contagious Abortion.</span>—A distinct disease which
causes the death and expulsion of the fetus or its
expulsion in a feeble state prior to the normal period.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms of Threatened Abortion.</span>—In the first three
months of pregnancy, the appearance of a bloody, watery
or mucous discharge from the vagina. In the later
months, uneasiness, swelling, heat and tenderness about
the udder; secretion of milk; and straining as if in labor.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Threatened Abortion.</span>—Give fifteen
drops of G.G., every six hours, and the dose may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>repeated two or three or more times should the threatening
symptoms continue after the first or even the second
dose has expended its action.</p>

<p class='c004'>This interval should elapse between doses, as too rapid
ones may even defeat the object, by over-excitement of
the system, while a single dose often arrests an abortion
if permitted to expand its action.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a cow has actually aborted, it is almost impossible
to tell whether it occurred from contagious
abortion or from some other cause, so the safe thing to
do is to act as if it had been contagious abortion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Contagious Abortion.</span>—The fetus and
membranes should be burned. The premises occupied
by the sick animal should be disinfected as follows:
Remove all bedding and dirt possible and spray all
available parts of barn with 3% formalin or 5% carbolic
acid solution. Apply white wash containing 1 lb. chloride
of lime to 3 gallons of whitewash, scatter quicklime on
floor and gutters.</p>

<p class='c004'>The animal which has aborted should receive daily a
vaginal irrigation of two gallons of warm water containing
2% lysol until the vaginal discharge stops. The
external parts about the vagina, including the hips and
tail, should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and
then with the lysol solution as above, twice daily. This
should also be done to all exposed pregnant animals in
the herd, being careful not to use the same cloth, solution,
bucket or attendant, for the well animals that was
used for the sick one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also give G.G., at intervals of six hours.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Falling and Protrusion of the Womb</h4>

<p class='c010'>After a difficult labor, or when manual help has been
injudiciously applied, the womb may be everted or
turned inside out. The organ then is partly or quite
protruded and appears as a deep red mass covered with
smooth red bodies (glands).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>In order to replace, the cow should stand with the
hind feet higher than the fore feet, the hand of the
operator should be wrapped with a soft cloth soaked in
warm milk and smeared with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary
Oil</span>, and <i>gentle pressure</i> should be <i>continuously and carefully</i>
applied to the mass until it gradually returns to its
proper position. Dry or inflamed parts should be washed
in warm milk and kept well anointed with the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span>. Give also A.A., at first every three hours, and
later alternate G.G., with the A.A., a dose once in six
hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where <span class='fss'>CASES</span> of <span class='fss'>SIMPLE PROTRUSION OF THE ORGAN</span> occur
without retroversion, give A.A., morning and G.G., at
night, feeding light easily digested food, which will be
effective.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.—<span class='sc'>Part II.</span><br> <span class='c007'>MECHANICAL INJURIES</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Burns</h4>

<p class='c010'>Injury to the skin and sub-cutaneous tissue by any
hot body requires careful treatment, not only because of
the local damage, but also because of possible injury to
the system.</p>

<p class='c004'>The air must be excluded as much as possible; and
the less the injured part is disturbed the better. It will
be found advantageous to apply one piece of linen,
smeared with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>, next to the
wound, so that it may not be necessary to remove it;
then over that a piece of several thicknesses, which may
be removed for the purpose of applying the <span class='sc'>Veterinary
Oil</span>. Often the part may be so situated that the plaster
or covering cannot be conveniently kept in place; then
the only application will be the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>, simply
applied with the end of the finger, so as to keep the sore
or burned place moist. Slight superficial burns require
only the application of the oil as above. During the
healing, simply apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give, also, for extensive burns, or deep burns, or scalds,
the A.A., every two or three hours at first, then morning
and at night. In extreme cases, or with extensive
ulcerations, give I.I., in alternation with A.A., after the
first fever has subsided.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Contusion—Bruise</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is defined as an injury inflicted on the surface of the
body by mechanical violence, without laceration of the
skin. It may be slight, involving only the rupture of
minute vessels, or it may tear the muscular fibres, or
wound a large blood vessel.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Blows from sticks; butts from horns; pressure
of the yoke on draught oxen.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—For slight affections of this kind, in the
nature of a bruise, bathe the part with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’
Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, three or four times per day,
and as often give a dose of the B.B. This will soon
remove the lameness and stiffness and restore the part,
as well as ward off injurious consequences. The administration
of the B.B., should never be omitted in these
cases.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Sprains</h4>

<p class='c010'>These injuries affect the ligaments that connect the
joints, and are caused by false steps, slipping, or by
forcibly twisting or contorting the joints to an extent
beyond that permitted by the natural limitations of
flexion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sprains happen to various members—the coronet joint,
the fetlock, the shoulder, etc. The pain, swelling and
inflammation which accompany these accidents are
proportioned to the extent of the injury.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>General Treatment.</span>—This consists in affording rest
to the limb, mitigating the pain and subduing inflammatory
action. Also apply to the part, when you know
where it is, <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, but in
all such cases give the B.B., for strains, lameness, etc.,
a dose at first, four times per day, and later, morning and
night.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Sprain of the Shoulder.</b>—Draught oxen are particularly
subject to this affection, which is caused by excessive
exertion in drawing, false steps, slips or external violence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—There is heat, pain, stiffness and imperfect
mobility of the limb; the animal trails it with evident
pain; does not raise it easily over any obstacle; when
standing, rests the weight of the body on the opposite
side.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the animal rest, and a dose of the
B.B., three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span><b>Sprain of the Haunch.</b>—Inability to move the hind
quarters and extremities is due to the same causes as
sprain of the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Limping and dragging the hind legs; when
standing, the beast keeps them apart. In severe cases it
can neither stand nor walk, but falls down, unable to
rise. Sometimes the lumbar region is hot, swollen and
painful.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The same as for other sprains. Give a
dose of B.B., three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Sprain of the Loins.</b>—The causes, symptoms and
treatment of this affection are much the same as for
sprain of the haunch.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Other Means.</span>—In some sprains it will be advisable to
precede the medicinal treatment by applications of
warm water, and afterwards to dry the parts with a cloth
before applying <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> or
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>. After the swelling has
subsided, the animal may only very gradually return to
its accustomed work. Give, always, a dose of B.B.,
morning and night, or even three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Choking</h4>

<p class='c010'>Foreign bodies in the œsophagus—obstruction of the
gullet. Roots that have not been cut into small pieces
before they are given to the cattle are sometimes swallowed,
especially if the beasts be very hungry. There is
no doubt about the symptoms, as the body may often be
felt externally, while difficulty of breathing, and violent
action of the muscles of deglutition, with a view to expel
the intruder, indicate what is the matter. Prompt action
is necessary, as the animal, if not relieved, becomes
hoven or wind blown.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If the obstruction be near the top of the
gullet, it may be removed by the hand put through the
mouth and protected by a common balling-iron.</p>

<p class='c004'>Try also pouring some oil or thin grease into the
gullet through a horn inserted into the mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>A pinch or small spoonful of coarse gun-powder put
far back <i>under the animal’s tongue</i>, will often cause a
violent regurgitation or vomiting, which brings up the
offending substance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give also F.F., every half hour, if the animal is bloated
or distressed with wind, or the J.K., if suffering from
indigestion.</p>

<p class='c004'>If it be too far down the œsophagus for removal in
this manner, the obstruction must be pushed into the
stomach. For this purpose a probang must be carefully
used. A good, common probang, which will not lacerate
the gullet, may be readily made from a piece of firm
rope, from half-inch to an inch in diameter and four or
five feet long. Wind the end of this from two or three
inches down to near the end with firm, strong twine, so
as to make a firm square, not pointed end. Secure the
twine carefully in the strands, so it will not unravel, or
yet better, wind the ends of the cord along in the strands
of the rope to the handle. Then smear the bulb and
rope with lard, and pass the probang down to the
obstruction, and, using it like a ram-rod, drawing it
back but a few inches at a stroke, you can readily drive
down the obstruction, without danger of lacerating the
gullet, as you are in great danger of doing by using a
“rakestail” or other piece of stiff wood, causing the
death of the patient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Wounds</h4>

<p class='c010'>Animals are often exposed to wounds, which differ in
character and importance, according to the manner in
which they have been produced, the extent of the injury,
and the part wounded.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Incised Wounds</b> are produced by instruments with
sharp edges; these wounds have no jagged edges, and
heal most rapidly.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Stab Wounds</b> may not appear very considerable on
the surface, but may be very serious, as important parts
may have been injured. If a bowel has been cut, blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>is generally discharged from the anus, or the contents of
the bowel escape through the external wound. If the
parts around a stab wound soon begin to swell, blood-vessels
and intestines have probably been injured, and
extravasation of blood takes place.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Lacerated Wounds</b> are caused by rough and blunt
bodies, have a jagged and uneven appearance, and,
although large and important blood-vessels have been
divided, in general there is but little bleeding.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If dirt, wood, glass, sand, shot, or any
other substance have got into the wound, remove them
by a sponge and cold water; in some cases a syringe may
be required for this purpose. If there is much bleeding,
this must be arrested by using a sponge dipped in cold
water, or with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> or
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>, and gently pressed upon
the wound. If <i>arteries</i> have been severed, they will have
to be grasped with a pair of forceps, and drawn slightly
and gently forward, so that they may be securely tied
by means of a strong ligature of silk. You may know
an artery has been injured by the blood being bright red
and coming in spurts. The healing of <i>cut-wounds</i> is
facilitated by bringing the edges together by means of
adhesive plaster, or by stitching them. Before sewing up
a wound, the bleeding should have ceased, and the
operator must be careful that all foreign bodies, loose
shreds of tissue, and clots of blood are carefully removed;
otherwise inflammation will be produced, and the
stitches will have to be removed. The sides of the
wound should first be placed closely together, as before
injury; each thread should be tied by itself, so that if
one stitch breaks out, others may remain undisturbed.
Well-waxed silk or strong thread should be used, and as
many stitches inserted as may be necessary to unite the
edges of the wound.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give A.A., and apply the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> in all cases
of injury.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Caries of the Bones</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Swelling of the bones; great tenderness to
the touch; frequently a suppurating wound. The disease
is very serious, and very difficult to cure.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—You may give the J. K., each morning,
and the I.I., at night, with advantage.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fractures</h4>

<p class='c010'><b>Horns.</b>—When a cow breaks a horn there is considerable
hemorrhage, which should be arrested by applications
of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>. If the horn
be warm, it is just possible to restore it by immediately
putting it in its place and fixing it there with bandages.
The animal should then be tied up to a ring, by itself,
so that it cannot rub against anything. The stump, or
replaced horn, should be wrapped in cloths after being
well covered with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>. B.B.,
should be given internally, once or twice per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Bones.</b>—The <i>ossa ilium</i>, or flank bones, are most liable
to fracture.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In fractures, wherever situated, it is indispensable
to keep the part at rest as much as possible;
consequently most fractures incidental to cattle admit of
no efficatious treatment. In simple fractures, where the
proper splints and bandages can be applied, recovery
may ensue.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Poisonous Plants</h4>

<p class='c010'>Cattle sometimes eats poisonous plants, such as acrid
buds of oak, twigs of yew, the water hemlock, and others,
and consequently suffer and die. Unless it is known that
they have had access to such plants, it is not always easy
to determine the nature of the disorder from which
they are suffering. If there be suspicion of poisoning,
the following treatment may be pursued, when the
symptoms seem to indicate it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Torpor; refusal of food; excessive thirst;
distention; the animal shows signs of great agony, grinds
its teeth, stamps, paws the ground, strikes its flanks,
rolls on the ground, as if with spasms or colic. Sometimes
there is great fury, ending in torpor, paralysis,
death.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The stomach-pump should be employed;
water thrown into the rumen till vomiting ensues. This
should be repeated till the stomach is emptied.</p>

<p class='c004'>In general, however, and unless the animal be very
valuable and the circumstances favorable, such means
are not available, and you can only give the F.F. and
J.K., in alternation, one dose every half hour, or hour,
according to the urgency of the case.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Eczema</h4>

<p class='c010'>Eczema is a disease of the skin and in general appearance
is much like mange, but is unlike mange in the fact
that it is not caused by parasites, and therefore is not
contagious.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several forms of eczema are observed in cattle.</p>

<p class='c004'>1—An acute form which attacks the legs; there is dullness
and loss of appetite, followed by swelling, stiffness
and elevated points of hair on the legs.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—There is a chronic form attacking various parts
of the body with loss of hair and crusts.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—There is still another form caused by eating too
much potato pulp, this attacks the legs with redness,
swelling, crusts and general loss of condition.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eczema may be told from mange by the absence of the
parasites, which in cattle can usually be seen by the
naked eye; also in mange the itching is much more
intense than in eczema.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—First clean the sores, removing all dirt,
scabs, etc. For this purpose, olive oil is better than
water, as soap and water are apt to cause further irritation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Apply Zinc Ointment night and morning. Give
A.A., three times per day, for two days, then I.I.
instead of A.A.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Warbles</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is often seen on cattle in February and March.
It consists of a number of roundish swelling from five to
twenty in number, usually on the back and sides. The
swellings are sometimes as large as the closed fist.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the summer months the gadfly lays its eggs on
the skin of the cattle, especially just above the heels.
The cattle bite these places and swallow the eggs; which
hatch into larvæ and make their way through the body
to the skin, where they form these swellings. The
swellings suppurate and form a small hole, through which
the larvæ breathe and later escape. After the larvæ
have escaped the swellings subside.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Warbles may be prevented by keeping
the cattle from swallowing the eggs. Either by brushing
off the legs, or by applying kerosene oil, or a 3% solution
of creoline, or one of the proprietary products for keeping
flies off cattle. This should be done night and morning
during July and August.</p>

<p class='c004'>The larvæ may be killed as soon as the hole is first
formed; by injecting kerosene oil from an ordinary oil
can into the aperture, or by covering the hole with thick
grease, which prevents the larvæ from breathing. When
the larvæ are killed the swelling usually soon disappear.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='c007'>PART III.</span><br> Diseases of Sheep and Goats</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When a number of Sheep or Goats, or a flock, are
to receive medicine, the best and most economical, as
well as efficient method, is as follows: Procure a new or
perfectly clean pint bottle and cork, fill it two-thirds full
of pure water, to which add a <i>large spoonful, or sixty
drops</i>, of the proper remedy, <span class='fss'>SHAKE IT THOROUGHLY</span>, so as
to perfectly medicate the whole mass. Of this a dessert
spoonful is a dose for a sheep or goat. Paste a proper

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c007'>GENERAL DISEASES</span></h3>
<h4 class='c009'>Black Leg</h4>

<p class='c010'>Known as <i>Quarter Ill</i>, or the <i>Black Spauld</i> of the
English Shepherds, or as one of the “Murrains” of this
country. It affects young and thrifty sheep, and is rarely
found in old and poor stock. It is most common in wet
seasons, in the early spring or summer and fall, and
when the feed is very luxuriant. The sheep gorge themselves
with the rich vegetation, and the digestion being
over-taxed, the system is disorganized and the sheep
suddenly droop and die. On examination, the wool
leaves the skin at the slightest touch, and the body is
found to be swollen and blackened in large patches,
chiefly on the hind or fore quarter. Air is infiltrated
under the skin, and the carcass seems already decomposed
and full of black blood. On examining the flock, some
will be lame or limping, the eyes red, and the mouth and
tongue inflamed and blistered, and on passing the hand
over the sides or quarters, they will be found swollen,
the wool readily coming off, and a crepitation be heard
from the confined air beneath. The urine is dark, the
bowels constipated and dung bloody. After a time the
animal is unable to stand, and falls upon the side;
stretches out the limbs and in a few hours is dead.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The disease is worse on moist, rich bottom lands, and
is rare on dry hills or gravelly soils. To prevent the
disease, such soils and localities should be avoided, and
the sudden changes from poor to such rich and succulent
and abundant pasturage.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The disease is incurable, and diseased
animals should be killed at once, the bodies burned and
the premises disinfected as given under Abortion, page <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>.
The healthy animals should be moved to another pasture
and the infected pasture burned off the following winter,
this destroys the germs in that pasture.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cattle may be rendered immune to Black Leg by
vaccination. The vaccine with directions for its use is
given away to stock owners by the Chief of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Foot and Mouth Disease—Eczema Epizootica</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—An acute, contagious fever, characterized
by the formation of vesicles and ulcers, chiefly about the
mouth and hoofs, etc. The eruptions appear on the
mucous membrane of the mouth, on the fetlock,
and in the cleft of the hoofs, and not unfrequently as a
eruption on the udder. The disorder chiefly prevails
among cattle and sheep, but under favoring circumstances,
also attacks other domestic quadrupeds, and even man.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—It appears as an epidemic, and spreads
exclusively by contagion. The precise nature of the germ
is unknown, but it is chiefly limited to the contents of the
vesicles, the secretion of the ulcers, the saliva, the blood
and the natural secretions and excretions, of the diseased
animal; and these convey the disease. The predisposing
causes are exposure to cold, wet, currents of cold air, poor
fodder, want of cleanliness and good housing; and anything
that tends to lower the constitutional vitality. The
activity of the virus is preserved for many months. The
poison may be conveyed by the clothes of herdsmen and
other persons, by manure, tools, fodder, by grass and
ground previously trodden by diseased animals, and milk
to suckling calves, indeed by almost anything. It finds
its way into the system in various ways, not depending
on any wound for admission. The communication to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>man is by drinking the milk of diseased cows. A second
attack is rare.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—After a period of incubation, lasting from
three to six days, the animal is seized with a shivering
fit, and appears dull and stupified. A vesicular eruption
soon appears on the mouth, the hoofs, and the teats.
Suckling lambs, have a similar eruption on the mouth and
throat, with irritation of the whole alimentary canal,
attended with inability to suck, and exhausting diarrhea.
The eyes are then observed to be dim, watery, congested;
the muzzle, ears and horns alternately hot and cold;
shivering ensues; rumination is diminished; the milk is
less in quantity, yellower and thicker than usual, and
much deteriorated in quality; the bag swollen, tender,
hot; the back arched; the coat staring and harsh; the
pulse somewhat accelerated; the temperature moderately
elevated, reaching 102°, or even 104°; the eruption in the
mouth is first seen on the inner surface of the upper lip,
the edge of the upper jaw where there are no teeth, on
the tip and edges of the tongue, and is indicated by
salivation, by pain and loss of power in taking and eating
food. The vesicles occur on the mucous membrane,
singly or in patches, first as little red spots, then as
whitish-yellow, slightly turbid blisters, about the size of
a bean, at first transparent, but subsequently filled with
a puriform fluid. These vesicles burst in about eighteen
hours, discharge their fluid, leaving behind shallow
ulcers, which often run together and then form deep and
ragged ulcers. The lips, cheeks, tongue, and sometimes
the Schneiderian membrane, are affected. The eruption
on the feet is first seen around the coronet and in the
interdigital space, especially of the hind legs; and the
resulting vesicles burst quickly, because of the animal’s
movements. The animal evidently suffers intense pain,
is lame or unable to stand, and moves reluctantly or
cautiously; the hoofs swell; the vascular secreting membranes
become inflamed; the hoofs are cast; the bones
may become diseased; and serious mischief may ensue.
The eruption on the udder turns to vesicles, as in the
mouth, and, when the fluid dries or escapes, thin scales
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>are formed. The teats are swollen and sore. In exceptional
cases, a vesicular eruption appears on the muzzle,
the mucous membrane of the nostrils, the conjuctivae
of the eyes, and the mucous membrane of the vagina.</p>

<p class='c004'>In favorable cases, the fever subsides about the fourth
day, the eruption declines, the appetite returns, and in
seven to fourteen days the animal recovers. But complications
are not uncommon. And in unfavorable cases
the fever is high, the ulceration increases, the animal
suffers from exhaustion, wasting, discharge of stringy,
bloody mucous from the mouth, and of offensive matter
from the nostrils; the face is swollen, the breath foul, the
respiration rapid and grunting; the pulse small, weak,
rapid; the blood becomes impure; the belly and legs
œdematous; the hoofs slough off; diarrhea supervenes,
and death follows about the ninth or tenth day.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Prognosis.</span>—This is unfavorable—The United States
Government and the Health Officers of the several States
require all suspected cases of Foot and Mouth Disease to
be quarantined, and upon the full development of the
disease all animals infected to be killed. Human beings
are liable to become infected, great care should be exercised
in handling diseased animals or their carcases.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Liver Rot—Liver Fluke Disease</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a very destructive disease and causes much loss
to sheep raisers each year.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is caused by a small worm called the Distoma; which
is swallowed by the sheep in water or on grass and which
makes its way to the liver, where it lives. These worms
only exist in low damp land, high dry pastures are free
from them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The sheep becomes dull and listless,
followed by loss of flesh and strength, the wool comes off
easily. The loss of strength continues and death usually
ensues.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Since the worms only exist for any length
of time in low damp land; and high dry pastures are
usually free from them; the sheep should be removed to
the dry pastures. Rock salt should be given freely to the
infected sheep. There is no known cure for this disease.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.—<span class='sc'>Part III.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Encephalitis, Inflammation of the Brain</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease may arise from internal causes, but more
frequently from sun-stroke, blows upon the head, too
plentiful food, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The animal ceases to eat; hangs its ears
and head, which are hot to the touch; walks along
staggering, unconscious whither it goes; the eyes are
bright and red and projected from the head; the air it
expires is hot; the breathing short, rapid and accompanied
with violent beating of the flanks; it remains
lying down, head stretched on the ground, and, as the
disease draws to a close, it ends in convulsions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A.A., a dose of three or five drops
every hour, during the height of the disease, and then at
longer intervals as the case improves.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Apoplexy</h4>

<p class='c010'>In consequence of that plethora, which is the result of
over-feeding in fattening, sheep are quite liable to
apoplexy, and when in this condition they are driven
rapidly some distance in warm weather, they are quite
liable to a fit of this disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Generally there are some symptoms which
indicate that an animal is about to have a fit of this very
frequent complaint. These are: Dullness; frequent
standing still, or remaining behind the others, the
breathing is quickened; it seems sleepy and unaware of
what is going on around; the eyes appear as if they were
blind; the pupils are reddened and nostrils dilated;
pulse is quick and hard; the membranes of the nose and
eyes are red; then, from standing fixed as it were in one
place, it staggers and falls; then is violently convulsed,
and, unless relieved, death speedily ensues.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The A.A., if given before the convulsion,
a dose of three or five drops, will often arrest its farther
progress. If the fit has taken place, give the medicine at
once, and repeat the dose again after the animal gets
over it, should it survive the fit.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Louping Ill</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is more common in the spring of the year
when it attacks sheep and particularly lambs.</p>

<p class='c004'>It begins with twitching and tremblings; sometimes
even convulsions. The animal falls and may even leap
into the air. This is later followed by paralysis of part
of the body, and the head being drawn to one side.</p>

<p class='c004'>This disease is due to bacteria which are transmitted to
the sheep by the grass tick. No cure is known. Diseased
sheep should be killed and the rest of the flock dipped
for Scab, as on page <a href='#Page_211'>211</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Trotters—Nibblers</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a disease somewhat like louping ill but appears
to be heriditary.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The sheep trembles when touched and
walks with a peculiar gait, raising the feet high (Trotters).
Later there appears to be an itching, since the animal
rubs and bites its hind quarters (Nibblers). This is
followed by wasting, paralysis and death.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—There is no known cure and diseased
animals should be slaughtered and not bred from.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Epilepsy—Fits</h4>

<p class='c010'>In sheep, this disorder frequently occurs on a fine, cold
morning in spring, early summer and autumn, within an
hour or two of daybreak. On rising from its bed, the
animal stares, staggers, falls, struggles convulsively for a
few minutes, kicks, rolls its eyes, grinds its teeth, foams
at the mouth, and sometimes involuntarily voids dung
and urine. After a few minutes, or perhaps half an hour,
the fit subsides, the animal rises, seems semi-conscious,
presently begins to eat, and appears to be in good health.
These fits may occur daily, and then will soon become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>fatal; or, by occasional repetition, they may wear away
the creature’s flesh and strength.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A few doses of A.A., on the day of attack,
followed by a dose of A.A., each morning, and of J.K.,
each night, are the proper remedies. A change of pasture
and shelter should be provided.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Rabies—Hydrophobia—Madness</h4>

<p class='c010'>When a mad dog has entered a fold, it is often difficult
to determine which sheep have been bitten and which
remain untouched. Careful examination, one by one,
should be made; still uncertainty remains. The symptoms
appear from two to ten or twelve weeks after attack,
and are similar to those which appear in other animals.
The sheep annoy and chase each other, cease to feed,
lose flesh, are restless, and manifest strong and unnatural
sexual desire. Ewes become stupified and paralyzed,
and die, often without a struggle. Lambs have convulsive
fits, terminated by death. Rams and wethers, butt
their heads against the ground, palings, banks and one
another; running full tilt, with great violence and frequency,
so as to tear the skin from their foreheads.
They usually die in from 3 to 6 days.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A.A., should be given every day, to all the
flock, for a few days, then once a week for several weeks.
If an animal develops the symptoms it should be killed
at once, since there is no known cure. However few
animals or persons bitten by supposedly mad dogs ever
develop the disease.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dizziness, Staggers, Sturdy, Turn-Sick, Gid.</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a very dangerous and not infrequent disease.
Its immediate cause is the presence of a small worm,
inclosed in a hydatid or sack of fluid, and located
either within the substances of the brain, or beneath
the bones of the cranium. These hydatids vary in size,
number and position, being found on the right or left
side, indicated by the animal turning to the right or
left, or in the centre of the median line, in which case it
may turn to either side, or not at all, the animal carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the head down. When the hydatid occupies the back
of the head, the animal holds the head high, and runs
straight forward, throwing itself on any object it meets.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—As above indicated, the symptoms consist
of various forms of turning, whirling around or standing
still, etc. At first, when the hydatids are small, there
may be but little or nothing to indicate their presence;
but as they grow larger, they press upon the bone, and
even enlarge or remove a great portion of it. One side
of the head may be enormously enlarged, or the bone
become quite thin, so that the situation of the cyst may
be thus known, and sometimes a small hole may be discerned.
The sacks are more frequently on the left side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first effects are: dullness, loss of spirits; they chew
the cud slowly and carelessly; they keep aloof from the
other sheep; they stagger when walking; stand before a
pool of water looking into it, and sometimes tumble in
and are drowned; sometimes when eating they appear as
if frightened, and run over the field as if pursued; the
head is held higher or lower, or carried on one side; the
body, in moving, inclines to the same side; the sheep
appear to wander about, and gradually lose flesh and
strength; then they begin to turn round and round to
one side; seem quite unconscious of everything around
them; the round and round movements increase until
they are almost constant, and the animal at length dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Puncturing through the skull into these
cysts, when their presence is known by the swelling, is
sometimes successful if the precise point is known and no
other exists. Give A.A., a dose of two or five drops every
night at first, and then at longer intervals. Few sheep
treated survive and unless the animal is very valuable for
breeding, it is better to slaughter as soon as the disease
begins to appear. Although this disease is very hard to
handle after it gets started, it can be easily prevented.
The worm which gets into the brain is the larvæ of the
tape worm of the dog, which the sheep gets from eating
grass soiled by the dogs feces. The dog in turn gets this
worm from the sheep by eating the brains which contain
the larvæ. The remedy therefore is simple. Don’t feed
uncooked sheeps brains to dogs.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.—<span class='sc'>Part III.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Cold, Catarrh</h4>

<p class='c010'>The nose and air-passages are lined with a delicate
membrane, whose office it is to secrete a thin mucous
which lubricates the parts. Under the influence of a
chill, suppressed perspiration, etc., this membrane
becomes irritated, inflamed, and the discharge arrested,
or it is thickened, increased, or variously modified.</p>

<p class='c004'>The symptoms usually are, the sheep is not so lively
as usual; he eats little or no food; he coughs and sneezes;
a watery discharge flows from one or both nostrils, and
also from the eyes, which are red and swelled.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the more severe form, there is a chill, warm skin,
quick pulse, frequent and somewhat difficult breathing,
sore throat, pain in the throat when pinched, frequent
cough, rough coat, bound bowels, red eyes, and red and
dry nose; tears flow freely, and little or no food is eaten—all
symptoms indicating a catarrhal fever. As the
animal improves, the discharge from the nose becomes
white or yellowish, and more profuse.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—When the disease commences with a
chill, or any considerable degree of fever is present, give
fifteen drops of the A.A., and repeat it several times, at
intervals of one or two hours. Then alternate the E.E.,
with the A.A., at intervals of two or three hours, until
the disease is broken up.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cough</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is usually a symptom of some primary disorder
on the cure of which it will disappear. It may, however,
be a passing irritation. A persistent cough is suggestive
of serious ailment, and, without delay, give the E.E.,
and you may save the animal.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Laryngitis</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Laryngitis, or inflammation of the lining membrane of
the windpipe, is due to cold, changeable weather, etc.
It is distinguished from bronchitis (see next section) by
a characteristic <i>ring</i> in the cough. The open mouth,
with outstretched head, indicates difficulty of breathing
and a sense of suffocation. This frequently ensues from
thickening of the membrane and closure of the <i>rima
glottidis</i>, or entrance to the windpipe. A.A., a dose two
or three times per day, is the treatment.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bronchitis, or Inflammation of the Bronchial Tubes</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is usually the result of exposure to cold
and wet, or sudden changes of temperature; it is almost
always preceded by a common cold, which has been
neglected or overlooked.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Cough, which becomes by degrees more
painful, frequent and husky; the countenance becomes
anxious and distressed; the breathing is quick, heaving
and obstructed, in consequence of tough, tenacious
phlegm; unwillingness to move; the breath is hot; the
cough is increased by moving about, occurs in fits, and
is wheezing in character; no food is eaten; the animal
wastes; skin becomes dry, and is bound to the ribs; the
coat stares and looks unthrifty. The animal may die
from extension of the disease to the substance of the
lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The earlier stages of this disease, or
catarrh, should be treated at once, as directed under
that head. Then a dose or two of the Remedy for that
disease removes all danger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Remove the animal to a warm but well ventilated
stable, and feed on warm mashes and gruel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give first, at intervals of two hours, two or three doses
of the A.A., twenty drops at a dose. This will allay the
heat and fever to some extent. Then alternate, at
intervals of three hours, the E.E., with the A.A., the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>same doses, and continue this treatment until restored,
only that the medicine need not be given so frequently
after improvement has progressed.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pneumonia—Inflammation of the Lungs</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease may be caused by exposure to cold and
wet; too severe weather; sudden changes of weather;
cold nights and mornings and hot middays, are apt to
induce it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Want of appetite; loss of the cud; dull,
staring eyes; ears are hung down; the head is held up;
the mouth open; breathing quick, labored and difficult,
with heaving of the flanks; grating of the teeth; inside
of the nose and white of the eyes much reddened; a
discharge, at first thin and watery, afterwards mattery
and offensive, flows from the nostrils; frequent painful
cough, attended with rattling in the throat. These
symptoms gradually become more and more severe, until
the animal dies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The A.A., will generally be found sufficient.
Give a dose of five drops every two hours. Should
the disease not yield in a day or two, the E.E., in doses
of five drops, may be alternated with the A.A., every
three hours.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Tympanitis—Hoove—Blown—Maw Bound</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disorder—is of two kinds; one due to the evolution
of gas from the food taken, the other to the impaction of
the food. In one case the gas produces enormous inflation
of the rumen, or first of the four stomachs possessed by
sheep, in the other, distention.</p>

</table>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—This is the same whether the distention
is from gas or impacted food. F.F. may be given, a dose
every quarter or half hour. We give the method of
puncturing, which, however, need never be resorted to
if the F.F. be administered.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Puncturing.</i>—Relief is sometimes very urgently required,
and this is best afforded either by plunging a trocar into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the left side, or by passing a probang down the œsophagus
into the paunch. If the trocar is used, let the canula on
the instrument be ten or twelve inches long, so as to
prevent the paunch from slipping away from the canula
and causing delay, and perhaps further danger. <i>Chloride
of Lime</i> is valuable after the animal is somewhat relieved
by the use of the trocar; about two drachms should be
mixed with a quart of water. In case of immediate relief
being imperative, and a trocar not being at hand, a long,
sharp pointed pen-knife may be used for puncturing.
The place for puncturing is midway between the hip and
ribs, where the distended rumen is prominent; the
direction is inward and downward. The puncture will
be followed by an outrush of gas, fluid, and even portions
of food. A quill, or some other tube, must be ready to be
inserted in the hole immediately after the knife is withdrawn,
otherwise the wound will close. If nothing
tubular be at hand, a smooth piece of stick must be put
in, or anything else that will serve the purpose of keeping
open the wound till the gas has escaped. The danger of
this operation is not from the wound itself, but from the
escape of the contents of the paunch into the abdomen,
which would cause peritonitis, or from piercing the
spleen or kidney. The operation can only be regarded
as a rough one, to be adopted in case of great emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>When distention has ceased and matters have to some
extent resumed their ordinary course, the animal should
remain some hours without food or water. The food
afterwards should be sparing and suitable.</p>

<p class='c004'>J.K., should be administered two or three times daily
until the animal is fully recovered.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Colic—Gripes</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is not common in sheep; but lambs over-fed
with milk, or with relishing herbs, or pastured in
rank or acrid grass, are subject to it (see following section
on enteritis).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—F.F., a dose every half hour until relieved.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Enteritis, Inflammation of the Bowels</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease is manifested by the following symptoms:
Violent and constant pain in the bowels, producing at
first uneasiness, and then rolling about on the ground;
the sheep almost constantly getting up and lying down
again; it sometimes lies on its back, the ground is pawed,
the belly struck with the hind feet, etc. These symptoms
of pain are attended with confined bowels, quick
pulse, cold legs and nose; the belly is tender when
pressed upon.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The A.A., is the appropriate remedy for
this disease, and may be given, five drops every one,
two or three hours, according to the urgency of the
disease.</p>

<p class='c004'>In cases of extreme distress it may be alternated with
the F.F., at intervals of a half hour or hour, until
relieved. But usually the first named Remedy will be
quite sufficient.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diarrhea</h4>

<p class='c010'>Purging is most common in spring, and is then occasioned
by fresh grass, to which the flock are unaccustomed;
lambs are subject to a severe and often fatal
form of this complaint, caused by the irritation of grass
eaten for the first time. In some instances it may be
occasioned by cold or by a peculiar irritation of the
mother’s milk.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease is manifested by discharge of
various colors, and sometimes very profuse. It is accompanied
with loss of appetite and wasting of flesh.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If the discharge is merely the effort of
nature to rid the system of some hurtful substance, it
will require no interference. But if it is excessive or
wasting, three or five drops of the F.F., given morning
and night, will usually be sufficient to arrest the disease.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Flukes, or Rottenness</h4>

<p class='c010'>This term is applied to the condition caused by the
presence of fluke worms in the liver or bile ducts, where
they sometimes exist in large numbers, causing great
swelling of the liver.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—The disease is chiefly developed in low districts,
and after damp seasons. The worms are taken in with
the food and developed in the liver.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Depression, sadness, inertness, loss of
appetite; watery, red, yellowish, purulent eyes; yellowish
tint of all parts not covered with hair; fœtid smell of
nose and mouth; hard skin; dull, erect hair; irregularity
of excrement, which is white, watery and fœtid.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The principal remedies are A.A., at first,
and then, after a day, alternate C.C., with the A.A., a
dose once in three or four hours.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Constipation</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is rarely of grave consequence, and when it exists,
is usually a symptom of some other disease. When
present, a dose of twenty drops of the J.K., given morning
and night, will soon set all right again. If there is
suspicion of some inflammatory condition lurking in the
system, the A.A., in like doses, will have the like effect.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dropsy</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is known as the accumulation of water or serous fluid
in the abdomen. It is usually the result of inflammation
of the peritoneum or lining membrane of the abdomen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>It may be known by the large and pendulous condition
of the belly, and by percussing or striking one part of
the belly, while the other hand is held against another
part, when, if water is present, the fluctuation is easily
perceived. It is caused by any exposure or food that
will produce the original inflammation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give five drops of the H.H., three times
per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Founder</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sheep are occasionally foundered from similar causes
which produce it in other animals. It is manifested by
the following symptoms: It walks slowly; head depressed;
has no sprightliness; poor appetite, but great
thirst. After a time this slowness of walking becomes a
rigidity, so that it requires great effort for the animal to
lie down or get up again. The appetite diminishes and
thirst increases. In the more advanced stages, the eyelids
are swollen, the eyes more or less inflamed, and the
feet extremely hot; still farther advanced, there is no
appetite, feet are burning and hot, the animal is in so
much pain from movement that it will only walk to
satisfy its raging thirst. It drags itself along often on its
knees rather than walk. It moans and groans, there is
severe fever, short breathing, and severe beating of the
flanks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—B.B., three drops, three times per day,
or morning and night if the case is not urgent. If there
is heat or fever, the A.A., may be given as an intermediate
remedy.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Abortion</h4>

<p class='c010'>Abortion or premature birth may occur from three
different causes:</p>

<p class='c004'>1—<span class='sc'>Accidental Abortion.</span>—Caused by a blow; strain;
slipping on a wet floor, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>2—<span class='sc'>Enzootic Abortion.</span>—Due to some infectious disease
of the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>3—<span class='sc'>Contagious Abortion.</span>—A distinct disease which
causes the death and expulsion of the fetus or its
expulsion in a feeble state prior to the normal period.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms of Threatened Abortion.</span>—In the first three
months of pregnancy, the appearance of a bloody, watery
or mucous discharge from the vagina. In the later
months, uneasiness, swelling, heat and tenderness about
the udder; secretion of milk; and straining as if in labor.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Threatened Abortion.</span>—Give fifteen
drops of G.G., every six hours, and the dose may be
repeated two or three or more times should the threatening
symptoms continue after the first or even the second
dose has expended its action.</p>

<p class='c004'>This interval should elapse between doses, as too rapid
ones may even defeat the object, by over-excitement of
the system, while a single dose often arrests an abortion
if permitted to expand its action.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a ewe has actually aborted, it is almost impossible
to tell whether it occurred from contagious
abortion or from some other cause, so the safe thing to
do is to act as if it had been contagious abortion.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Contagious Abortion.</span>—The fetus and
membranes should be burned. The premises occupied
by the sick animal should be disinfected as follows:
Remove all bedding and dirt possible and spray all
available parts of barn with 3% formalin or 5% carbolic
acid solution. Apply whitewash containing 1 lb. chloride
of lime to 3 gallons of whitewash, scatter quicklime on
floor and gutters.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>The animal which has aborted should receive daily a
vaginal irrigation of two gallons of warm water containing
2% lysol until the vaginal discharge stops. The
external parts about the vagina, including the hips and
tail, should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and
then with the lysol solution as above, twice daily. This
should also be done to all exposed pregnant animals in
the herd, being careful not to use the same cloth, solution,
bucket or attendant, for the well animals that was
used for the sick one. Give G.G., at intervals of six hours.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Bearing</h4>

<p class='c010'>By this term is indicated a common affection of the ewe
during the lambing season, which is generally produced
by injuries inflicted upon the parts of generation in
forcibly extracting the lamb from the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The parts should be well washed with
tepid water, and <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> applied. A.A., should
also be given internally, two or three times a day; in
some cases, alternated with I.I.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Garget—Inflammation of the Udder</h4>

<p class='c010'>Garget is a disease which prevails amongst ewes
during the lambing season. It arises generally from the
action of cold and wet upon the udder. Lying with the
udder in contact with the cold, wet ground will produce
garget; also prevalence of wet and easterly winds.</p>

<p class='c004'>The udder swells considerably, is excessively tender,
and speedily becomes hard and hot; the pulse rises;
the appetite fails, and more or less fever is present. The
progress of the disorder is very rapid, and often fatal;
prompt treatment is consequently required.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The animal must be removed to a warm,
sheltered situation, free from wet and cold. The best
remedy is the A.A. It is the more demanded if the
pulse is much disturbed and the patient feverish, and
a dose should be given three or four times a day. The
lamb must be allowed to suck, or the udder must be
otherwise emptied of its contents. As the fever abates,
use the C.C., in alternation with the A.A.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI.—<span class='sc'>Part III.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF LOCOMOTION AND SKIN</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Rheumatism</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sheep, particularly aged sheep and lambs, are subject
to rheumatism, sometimes acute, sometimes chronic.
They move stiffly, as if in pain, look thin and miserable.
The symptoms and treatment are the same as those for
the same disease in cattle (page <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>). In old sheep,
only partial relief can be given; they should therefore be
fed under shelter, ready for slaughter; if left to graze,
they may not feed at all. Lambs should be sheltered and
kept warm. B.B., is the proper and very useful remedy,
given daily.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Lameness</h4>

<p class='c010'>A sheep frequently manifests sudden lameness; when
it does so, the foot should be washed and examined. If
there be a stone, thorn, or other foreign substance in the
cleft, it should be removed, and the wound dressed with
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>. For other causes of lameness,
see sections on foot-rot, rheumatism, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Foot-Rot</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease usually results from foreign bodies, such
as sand, gravel, sticks, or dirt getting into the cleft of
the foot, although it sometimes appears to be contagious.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Lameness, swelling of the pastern, pain,
etc.; matter then forms, and unless it is let out, it will
spread in all directions under the foot and appear at the
coronet; long, narrow ulcers remain, and proud flesh
springs up from the diseased places.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Examine the foot carefully; remove all
dirt or other foreign matter; then foment the foot, night
and morning with hot water for an hour, and then apply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>a turnip or bran poultice; the hoof should be pared
down, and all the dead parts, or those likely to interfere
with the escape of matter, cut away; afterwards apply
the <span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> on a piece of cloth, bandaged to the
foot, to keep it in place and prevent dirt or other matter
getting into the sore. If the parts are healthy, the tar
and tallow application (equal parts) is very servicable.
The hoof will then begin to grow, during which care
must be taken to prevent dirt lodging in the wound and
causing fresh irritation. A dose of the I.I., every morning,
and of J.K., every night, will aid the process.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pock</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease which attacks the same animal but once
in life, and by preference the young ones of the flock,
is one which sometimes occasions fearful ravages among
sheep. It has its regular stages, like the small-pox, and
may be mild or malignant.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In the mild form, the animal is for two or
three days sad and dejected; then, on different parts,
more particularly on the inner surface of the fore-feet
and around the mouth, small red spots appear, whose
center is occupied by a pimple, terminating in a white
point. This stage of eruption is attended with feverish
shiverings, heat, especially of the ears and nose; redness
of the eyes and inner mouth; the animal is melancholy;
head down; feet close together; lameness, especially of
hind parts; no appetite or cud. The greater the number
of pustules; the worse the disease. The body is hot;
breathing short; a clear mucous flows from the mouth;
the parts occupied with pimples, especially the head,
swell so that the animal cannot open its eyes or mouth;
the fever continues; the pustules enlarge, and are filled
with fluid, first thin, and then becoming thick, yellow
and purulent. On the thirteenth day the pustules begin
to dry up, fever abates, pus hardens in the pustules,
becomes yellow, then darker, flatten, become scabs, and
by degrees fall off, leaving a dry scar behind. The drying
stage lasts from five to seven days.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Sometimes this disease assumes a malignant form, in
which the pock are very numerous, running together; the
symptoms violent, irregular, and the pock soon becomes
dark-colored. The pustules run together, forming extensive
ulcers beneath the wool, frequently destroying
the eyes and entire pieces of the lips and face.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—During the feverish stage, for the first
five or six days, give the A.A., five drops, four times
per day. Then give the I.I., the same dose morning and
night, until the animal is well. This I.I., given to the
well sheep, will so act as to either prevent their having it
at all, or only in a very mild form. The sound and
diseased, or suspected sheep, should be separated, as the
disease is very contagious, and easily communicated.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, however, the disease has appeared in a flock with
some severity, inoculation is best, quickest and safest.
This may be done on the forearm or other part, with
matter from a fresh pock, merely dipping the lancet in it
and inserting it just beneath the skin, not so as to cause
the blood to flow, or it may wash it out. The advantage
is, that all have it lightly, and get over it in three weeks,
otherwise the flock may be six months having it; and
not one per cent of inoculated animals will die. During
the disease they should not be kept too warm or be
over-fed.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Gadfly</h4>

<p class='c010'>The gadfly of the sheep (<i>œstrus ovus</i>), allied to the
gadfly of cattle (<i>œstrus bovinus</i>), is the plague of the flocks
in August and September, as the other is of the herds;
but it chooses a different place for the deposition of its
eggs. The locality selected is the alœ, or flaps of the
nostrils of the healthiest and finest sheep of the flock,
while they are sleeping in the pasture. There the eggs,
warm and moist, are speedily hatched. Thence the
larvæ ascending the nasal cavity, travel to the frontal
sinuses, where they remain, living on the mucous
secreted there, until their metamorphosis. During their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>course upward they irritate the delicate membrane with
their hooklets; and when then return from their hiding
place for expulsion from the nostrils in the following
spring, the irritation is renewed. The irritation, and
consequent inflammation, pain and sense of dizziness,
drive the sheep to distraction. The animal stamps,
throws up his head, sneezes violently, and repeats the
expulsive effort until the larvæ come away with a large
quantity of mucous. The number of larvæ is usually not
large; but when it is considerable, the inflammation may
turn to gangrene and cause death. After expulsion, the
larvæ bury themselves in the ground, assume the pupa
state, in two or three months come out as gadflies, and
again torment the sheep.</p>

<p class='c004'>The treatment of this affection by means of powders
blown up the nostrils, is often as irritating and injurious
as the presence of the larvæ. I.J., should be given
internally. The inhalation of fumes of sulphur will
cause sneezing; and if the larvæ be not already dead,
they should be destroyed.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fly</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sheep that are wounded by butting each other, or any
other cause, that have sores, that are dirty about the
tail and quarters, are attacked by a large blow-fly, which
deposits its eggs in the wound or putrescence. It is
during the summer, in sultry weather and after rain that
the fly is the most troublesome. After a while the eggs
are hatched, and the maggots burrow in the flesh of the
animal. Their presence is indicated by local swelling,
pain and dejection, and ultimate debility of the animal.
If the maggots are not promptly destroyed and the
wound kept clean, suppuration, deep ulcerations and
death ensue. Mercurial applications poison the sheep as
well as the maggots. The best treatment is to remove
the maggots and keep the wounds clean, and apply
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span> or a 2% lysol solution.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII.—<span class='sc'>Part III.</span><br> <span class='c007'>SCAB, TICKS AND DIPPING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sheep are infested with two kinds of external parasites.
(1) The sheep tick, which is a wingless fly, less than a
quarter of an inch long, and, (2) the acarus which causes
scab; of these there are several different species, but
since the symptoms are much the same and the treatment
exactly the same in all cases it is hardly worth while to
differentiate between them.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dipping</h4>

<p class='c010'>Dipping is now the accepted form of treatment for
external parasites of any kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are three objects sought for in dipping; (1) the
removal of external parasites; (2) improving the condition
of the skin; (3) increasing growth in the wool; of course
the first is the most important.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dips may be divided into two classes according to their
origin viz., proprietary dips and non-proprietary dips.</p>

<p class='c004'>A proprietary dip is one which is put up in packages
and sold as a dip and usually requires little handling to
be ready for use.</p>

<p class='c004'>A non-proprietary dip is one which the farmer makes
up himself from articles which he buys as crude drugs.
This is usually cheaper, but requires more handling in
preparing it for use.</p>

<p class='c004'>To-day, most, if not all proprietary dips on the market
have been approved by the Dep’t of Agriculture, and are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>about as effective as the non-proprietary dips. The
principal question is whether to pay a little more and
save the labor of preparing the dip, or pay less and do
the work yourself.</p>

<p class='c004'>All dips come under one of five classes, according to the
basic elements used; (1) Tobacco and Sulphur; (2) Lime
and Sulphur; (3) Coal tar; (4) Carbolic acid; and (5)
Arsenic.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tobacco and sulphur dip is very much used and is
highly recommended by the Dep’t of Agriculture. It is
prepared as follows: For every 100 gallons of dip required,
use 21 pounds of tobacco leaves and 16 pounds of flowers
of sulphur. Soak the leaves in cold or luke-warm water
for 24 hours in a covered vessel. Bring the water to a
boil and then remove from the fire. Allow to draw for
not less than one hour or preferably over night. Then
strain and press out all the tobacco juice. Mix the
flowers of sulphur in water so as to make a thin paste,
and pour this into the tobacco solution, stirring to keep
the sulphur from settling; add water if necessary to
make 100 gallons. Heat to about 100 degrees F. for use,
but be careful not to heat above 110 as the nicotine
would evaporate.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tobacco and sulphur dip is one of the best known.
It is cheap, effective and does not injure the wool. However
it does not keep and must be freshly prepared for
every dipping.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lime and sulphur dip is also a very good one and
is the dip usually recommended, or even sometimes
required by the Dep’t of Agriculture.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is prepared as follows: For 100 gallons of dip take
8 pounds of unslaked lime and 24 pounds of flowers of
sulphur. Place the lime in a kettle and add enough
water to make a paste; sift in the sulphur, stirring
so as to mix thoroughly. Then add 25 to 30 gallons of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>boiling water, and boil for at least two hours, stirring
both mixture and sediment frequently. Boiling should
be continued until the sulphur has disappeared from the
surface of the liquid; add water as necessary. Then
pour liquid and sediment into a barrel with a bunghole
about 4 inches from the bottom, and allow to settle for
two or three hours, and run off into dipping vat, and
add water to make 100 gallons.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is one of the cheapest and most effective dips, but
does sometimes injure the wool if it is long.</p>

<p class='c004'>The coal tar dips are of two classes, known as creosote
dips and cresol dips. They are sometimes home made,
but more often are proprietary. Of these dips, the
creosote dips are probably the best, for although both are
effective in destroying ticks and scabs, the creosote leaves
the wool in a clean, soft and pliable condition, while the
cresol dip is liable to leave it dry and harsh.</p>

<p class='c004'>The carbolic and arsenical dips are losing favor with
sheep raisers oh account of their poisonous character and
they are not highly recommended by the Dep’t of
Agriculture.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sheep should always be dipped twice. The first
dipping kills the mites, but usually does not get the
eggs, so they should be dipped again, about ten days
after the first dipping.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sheep should remain in the dip for one minute, to
destroy ticks, and two minutes for scab, and the head
should be plunged beneath the dip just before leaving the
tank, except where using carbolic or arsenical dips.</p>

<p class='c004'>If sheep become infested with ticks or scab, they
should be dipped irrespective of the season of the year.
Otherwise it is usual to dip them shortly after shearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>For large flocks of sheep, an elaborate dipping plant,
with permanent vat, cooking and heating apparatus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and herding and draining pens is necessary, but for a
few sheep on a general farm, a large tub will do and the
sheep can be lifted in and out of it onto a draining board
which will carry the drippings back into the vat.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c007'>GENERAL DISEASES</span></h3>
<h4 class='c009'>Distemper</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is one of the most common diseases of the dog,
and one that leaves in its train often very serious results.
The earlier symptoms are very insidious. There is
dullness; loss of appetite, flesh and strength may be
remarked, while purging and vomiting are not uncommon.
To this are added a short, husky cough,
watery eyes, increased redness of the vessels of the eye,
sensibility of the eye to light, increased frequency of the
pulse. As the disease advances, the animal shivers with
the cold, dislikes to be disturbed, seeks warmth, and
courts solitude; the bowels are confined; the membrane
of the eye covered with a fine net-work of bright red
vessels; a thick discharge of matter flows from the eyes;
the nostrils are covered with a glassy yellowish fluid;
the cough is increased in frequency, and comes on in
fits, which terminates in the discharge of a yellow,
frothy fluid from the stomach; the skin is hot. Often
with red spots on the under side of the body and
between the thighs.</p>

<p class='c004'>A later stage is marked by an increase of all the foregoing
symptoms. The body wastes, the shivering is
constant, the eyes are filled with a thick matter, which
glues the eyelids together in the morning, tenacious
matter clogs the nostrils and obstructs the breathing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>This causes much uneasiness and frequent but unsuccessful
attempts to overcome the cause of annoyance. The
discharge from the nostrils becomes bloody and offensive;
the breath is fetid; the lips are covered with ulcers;
short cries express pain; and the animal, becoming
weaker and worse in every respect, at last dies, a severe
diarrhea being the usual harbinger of that end.</p>

<p class='c004'>Distemper frequently results in chorea, or St. Vitus’
dance, paralysis, disease of the brain, ulcers on the eyes
and opacity, inflammation of the lungs, or in numerous
other ailments.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The earlier stages, before the discharge
is established, are best controlled by the A. A., of which
give a dose of three or five drops, according to the size
of the dog, morning, noon and night.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the catarrhal stage has come on, give three or
five drops of the C. C., four times per day. This will, in
general, carry the animal safely and speedily through
this ordeal. Should other diseases declare themselves,
they should be treated accordingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should a general or partial paralysis occur, or inability
to use one or several limbs, the J. K., should be given,
three or five drops, three times per day, until recovered.
(See paralysis.)</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Measures.</span>—A nutritious and easily digested
diet is of great importance in this disease, such as—milk,
bouillon, soup, scraped raw meat and beef tea.
If much diarrhea, boiled milk. If great loss of strength
or appetite, alcoholic stimulants may be added to the
milk or soup.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Simple or Inflammatory Fever</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is known by a fever, attended with increased heat of
the whole body, and with a quick, strong, decided pulse.
It attacks dogs of all breeds and ages, but most
frequently those from one year to three years old.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Sudden changes from heat to cold; jumping
into cold water after being very much heated from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>running; excitement from various causes. Fever is
accompanied with some degree of inflammation, however
it may be occasioned.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The fever comes on with a dislike to move,
and with a drowsy appearance, soon followed by great
restlessness; constant getting up, turning round, and
lying down again; great thirst; hard, frequent pulse;
hurried breathing; red, swollen, watery eyes; burning
heat of the whole body; dry, parched nose; intensely hot
mouth; as the disease progresses the restlessness increases,
and the dog stares, and frequently becomes unconscious.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A. A., from one to three drops,
according to the size of the dog, every two hours at first,
and as the patient mends, a dose four times per day;
and at the last, a dose of J. K., morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Rheumatism—Chest Founder—Kennel Lameness</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—An affection of the muscles and joints
accompanied with stiffness and tenderness. More often
of the chest, loins or back, but may occur anywhere.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Sudden exposure to cold and damp; going
into water after running fast; lying in a cold, wet
kennel; violent exercise. It chiefly attacks sporting dogs
and house dogs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Stiffness in the fore legs and shoulders;
stiffness of back, neck, and loins, animal cannot go up
or down stairs easily, howls when fore paws are lifted
from the ground; unusual firmness and tenderness of the
muscles of the chest when pressed; swelling at the knees,
with heat and tenderness; tenderness at the back of the
shoulder or the ribs; accelerated breathing; impaired
appetite; dry and hot nose. The animal often limps
with one paw, trails it, or holds it up as he goes along,
and howls when he puts it to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give, at first, and more especially if there
is heat or fever, A. A., a dose every three or four hours,
and later, if the lameness and stiffness is considerable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>give B. B., in alternation with the A. A., at similar intervals.
For simple rheumatic stiffness, give B. B., morning
and night. Dose, one to three drops, according to the
size of dog.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Measures.</span>—The animal must be kept warm
and dry, and protected from the inclemency of the
weather. No meat of any kind should be given.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dropsy</h4>

<p class='c010'>Dropsy is a morbid accumulation of watery fluid
confined to certain parts of the body, or affecting the
cellular tissue; the latter form, called <span class='fss'>ANASARCA</span>, is very
rarely seen in the dog. The most common forms are:
water in the cavity of the chest, <span class='fss'>HYDROTHORAX</span>; and
water in the abdomen, <span class='fss'>ASCITES</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—General Debility, brought on by want of
food; diarrhea suddenly checked; damp lodgings. It
may follow various diseases, such as inflammation of the
lungs, or retroceding skin disorders; or be caused by a
diseased state of the mesenteric glands, or of the liver.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Ascites is accompanied by enlargement of
the abdomen; the water is sometimes collected in the
abdominal cavity; at other times it is between the skin
and the peritoneum; in the former case there is not that
tense feeling which characterizes the latter. The
presence of water may be ascertained by resting one
hand on one side of the abdomen and striking the other
side, when <i>fluctuation</i> will be felt. <span class='sc'>Water in the chest</span>
is accompanied by oppressed breathing and cough; both
symptoms are aggravated by lying down. In either form
of the disease there is loss of appetite, disinclination to
move, the urine is passed in small quantities, the dog
loses flesh and becomes weak.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—H. H., by increasing the action of the
kidneys, is often efficient, a dose once in three hours.
If not efficient, alternate I. I., with the H. H., at the
same intervals.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Abscess</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—A collection of matter, generally appearing
between the skin and the cellular tissue—occasionally
close to the joint, and rarely (in the dog) upon some
internal organ. It may appear on any part of the body.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Injuries are the chief causes of abscesses in
the dog, but they sometimes appear from weakness after
certain diseases, especially distemper. When internal
abscesses form, they are due to too great care, too high
feeding, or want of sufficient exercise.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—A swelling appears, which is hot, painful
and inflamed; it increases in size, and finally bursts,
when the matter is discharged. In other cases there is
but little heat or tenderness, and the swelling increases
slowly, and is occasionally hardened. If hardening takes
place, instead of suppuration, there is usually a sub-cutaneous
fungoid growth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The I. I., is the remedy for such forms of
disease, and may be given, a dose of from one to three
drops, according to the size of the dog, three or four
times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Treatment.</span>—If an abscess appears to be
forming, the part should be narrowly examined to
ascertain if there has been any injury from a thorn, etc.
If anything is found, it must be at once carefully
removed, and <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> or
<span class='sc'>Veterinary Oil</span> applied to the part. This, if attended
to in time, will often prevent the formation of the
abscess. But if the swelling continue, and it is certain
that pus is forming, it will be hastened by fomenting the
part with warm water, three or four times a day; if the
swelling has increased in size and becomes softer, but
does not break, it will be necessary to open it with a
lancet or sharp pen-knife.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tumors</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—A deposit or growth of diseased structure
confined to the part where it first appears. The tumors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>generally seen on the dog are of two kinds—(1) indurated,
or hard; and (2) encysted, or enclosed in a sac or bag.
They are seldom painful, unless considerable pressure be
used; as a rule they are movable, and their extent can
easily be determined. <i>Encysted tumors</i> are the most
common; they vary in size, from that of a nut to that of
a pint measure. They are sacs or small bladders filled
with matter, smooth and soft, devoid of inflammation,
and lie close under the skin. At times their formation
is very slow; this is generally the case when they are due
to constitutional causes, a fact which can generally be
clearly ascertained.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>LACTEAL TUMORS</h5>

<p class='c010'>Tumors sometimes form in the teat when there is
obstruction in its canal; or when the milk is dried up too
soon or too quickly after suckling. They appear in
different parts of the gland, as small, movable, hard
bodies; increase in size; cause great inconvenience to the
animal; and form an eyesore to its owner. If their
progress be not arrested, they may ulcerate; or encysted
tumors may form, which, if injured by dragging along
the ground, may have a similar issue.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Bruises; wounds; constitutional tendency;
diseased condition of the secreting glands.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Hard tumors are best excised as soon as
they appear. The operation is simple, and the wound
will generally soon close up if left to the care of the dog,
and after a time will scarcely be seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Encysted tumors are also best removed by excision.
They may also be removed by tapping for the extraction
of the fluid, and the subsequent injection of iodine.
Should they become compound, they must be excised.
On the other hand, when it is known that they have
been caused by an injury, they will sometimes disappear
by the use of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>,
internally and externally.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Cancer</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>All tumors are not cancers, but in certain constitutions,
inflammation, indurated and encysted tumors may
degenerate into cancerous growths. The cancerous
tumor is at first small, hard, knotted and irregular in
form; it then grows larger, and is attached to the skin;
this inflames and ulcerates; and thus the cancer appears
on the surface. Its edges are irregular red or purple,
and indurated; it is attended with considerable pain and
a most disgusting discharge.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If in good health the tumor may be
excised while the dog is under chloroform. But the
cancer will return. If fully established, the animal
should be put out of its misery. The best application is
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>, and the best internal
treatment is the I.I., a dose two or three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Black Tongue</h4>

<p class='c010'>During the last few years a disease has been quite
prevalent in the south which has been called “Black
Tongue” whether this is a distinct disease or merely the
symptom of some other disease is as yet not known.</p>

<p class='c004'>The principal symptoms are congestion of the tongue
and mouth which causes the black color, this usually
leads to ulceration of the mouth and the ulceration
frequently extends so as to involve the entire digestive
tract. There is great weakness and emaciation with
death in a few days. Very few animals recover.
Besides these symptoms many others have been reported
but they vary so much in the different cases that they
have caused great doubt as to “Black Tongue” being a
distinct disease. The symptoms given might be Dumb
Rabies, page <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>; Canker of the Mouth, page <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>; Hook
Worm, page <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>; or Sore Throat, page <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>.</p>

<p class='c004'>In cases of so called “Black Tongue” we would advise
comparing the symptoms with those of the above diseases.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.—<span class='sc'>Part IV.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NERVOUS SYSTEM</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Apoplexy</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—A sudden, partial or complete loss of
consciousness and power of motion, occasioned by
determination of blood to the head.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Pressure on the brain, from a congested state
of the blood-vessels. Fat pet dogs are more subject to
an attack than dogs moderately fed and allowed plenty
of exercise.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Staggering walk, drowsiness, twitching of
the muscles of the face and limbs; these are premonitary
symptoms of an attack; or the fit may be sudden, when
the dog falls down without power of movement, with
loud and irregular breathing, and appears to be dying,
but generally, after three or four hours, he gradually
recovers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The A.A., is the proper remedy, and
may be given for the premonitions of an attack, a dose
morning and night. If he has had the fit, give a dose at
once, and repeat it again after two or three hours, and
then morning and night for a time, to prevent a relapse.
Dose, one to three drops, according to the size of the dog.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Wherever the fit occurs, if possible,
let the dog remain, and apply cold water to the head
with sponge. After recovery takes place, care must be
taken as to diet, only milk or oatmeal and water should
be given for a day or two.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Palsy, Paralysis</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is not an unfrequent affection in the dog,
especially those that are well fed, as pet dogs. It arises
from disease of the brain or spinal cord, and is sometimes
also the result of disease of the bowels or stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—It may occur in one side or part of the
animal, and is most frequent in the hind legs, which
appear as if the animal had no power over them; he
staggers, falls, or lies on the ground, dragging his hind
legs after him, unable to stand upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the J.K., two to five drops, according
to the size of the dog, three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>In case it comes on suddenly in well fed dogs, from an
over-feed or gorging the animal, give a spoonful of castor
oil and an injection of warm soap and water, followed
with the prescription above.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Epilepsy, or Fits</h4>

<p class='c010'>The dog is occasionally subject to true epilepsy, and
not unfrequently to fits or convulsions arising from
transient causes; such as teething in puppies, worms,
want of exercise, and then too violent exercise. They
are liable, also, to come on during distemper, or after it,
or from disease of the brain. Small pet dogs are more
subject to fits than others, as their nervous system is
more excitable and their lives more artificial.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The fit generally comes on suddenly, the
animal staggers, falls down, remains lying for an
instant, and then is violently convulsed; the legs become
stiff, the face distorted, the eyes roll about, the tongue is
thrust out, the jaws nearly closed or firmly clenched.
The convulsion becomes gradually less, and after some
twitches they cease, and the animal in a short time
appears well again.</p>

<p class='c004'>In true epilepsy the fits recur again at diminishing
intervals, and excitements may easily reproduce them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give on an attack, from whatever cause,
from two to five drops, according to the size of the
animal, of the A.A., and repeat it once after the paroxysm
is over. This will be sufficient for fits arising from any
transient cause; but if the dog is subject to them, he
must have J.K., alternately with A.A., a dose every day
or two, and continued for some time.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Chorea, St. Vitus’ Dance</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is a frequent result of severe distemper, especially
in the case of young dogs, intestinal worms, disorders of
the stomach or a weak and anemic condition seem to
predispose to this disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease manifests itself by twitches, or
involuntary jerks of various parts, as the leg, shoulder,
face, neck, or even eyelids. Sometimes it is confined to
a single limb or two, or the whole body may be affected.
The animal has no control over them, and they are
manifested sometimes during sleep. He wastes, eats and
sleeps badly, and may become palsied; at last he becomes
incapable of any service, staggers, has convulsions, and
is at last worn out.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the A.A., each morning, and J.K.,
each night, two to five drops, according to the size of the
animal, and follow the treatment perseveringly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Measures.</span>—Fresh air and fattening food
such as—rich milk, broth, oatmeal, meat once a day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Rabies, Canine Madness</h4>

<p class='c010'>Much has been said upon the subject of <i>Rabies</i>, or
<i>Canine Madness</i>, and from the general horror in which
the disease is justly held, some consideration of it is
proper, even if we do not possess the means of cure. It
is an acute disease, communicable from one animal to
another and from them to man. Occurring among men
it is known as hydrophobia. Its origin is unknown, but
it is supposed to have originated from the skunk.
Formerly it was very common among the wolves and
skunks of the western plains. The virus affects the
nervous system of the animal. It is found in some of the
secretions, chiefly in the salivary glands. The disease is
communicated only by the saliva of affected animals,
usually by biting. The disease may break out in from a
few days to a few months after the animal has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>bitten; the average time is about twenty-five days. Two
principal forms of this disease have been distinguished;
rabies proper, and dumb rabies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms of Rabies Proper.</span>—First change noticed is
in the dog’s gait in walking, either more lively and
irritable than usual, or more dull and sad; peculiar
restlessness; does not remain in one place; often quits
his home and roams to a distance; he recognizes and
obeys his master at the commencement, and even through
the entire disease; generally no appetite from the
commencement; some will take soup, but never solid
food; they often, however, devour strange things, as
wood, leather, straw, or even filth; they drink in all
stages of the disease, as long as they can swallow; there
is always a peculiar change of voice, more shrill or more
grave, always slightly hoarse and disagreeable; the bark
is peculiar, not in distinct emissions, as in health, but
an emission of voice ending in a howl; the desire to bite
is not constant, but comes occasionally in fits, and varying
degrees; during the fits he bites everything, cats,
other dogs, human beings, even his own master, or
inanimate objects, and frequently snaps at the air. At
first he is but little changed in appearance; but soon the
eyes become red; they open and shut alternately; later,
they are dull, as if covered with dust; rapid emaciation;
he becomes, finally, very weak, and drags his hind
quarters, while at first he is strong, carries his tail as
usual, and differs not in gait from a healthy dog.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dumb Rabies is manifested by loss of appetite, drink,
voice, as in the first instance, modified thus: The lower
jaw droops, apparently paralyzed from the commencement;
he cannot swallow any liquid; saliva constantly
flows from his mouth; the tongue often hangs from
between the teeth; he bites less than in the first form;
still, as there are times, when irritated, that he may
close his mouth, the danger from biting is the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are some popular errors, which are corrected by
the following statements, thus: Dogs may become mad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>at any season of the year. Female and altered dogs may
become mad by communication, though the disease
originates, probably, with entire animals. Mad dogs
drink in all stages of the disease, if the soreness of the
throat, or paralysis of the jaws, or flow of saliva does not
prevent them; they have even been known to swim in
water. Mad dogs do not always carry the tail between
the legs, but otherwise, during the commencement of the
disease; it is however, common in many other diseases,
and in all dogs when pursued or frightened. Mad dogs
do not always run in a straight line, unless pursued;
they change their direction like other dogs, and run to
objects which attract them. Other dogs do not avoid
them, but if a stranger, it will be attacked by well dogs.
Sound animals have no repugnance to the saliva of a
mad dog, but will even eat meat which is covered with it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—All the means hitherto discovered to
arrest the disease have proved unreliable. <span class='sc'>Belladonna</span>
and the A.A., may do something, and had best be
administered in all doubtful cases: but if an animal is
indisputably rabid, it should be killed at once. The
excision of the gland or ligament under the tongue is
only mutilating the animal to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>If a dog is suspected, or has been bitten, or exposed to
contagion, give him the A.A., three or four drops,
according to his size, three times per day, and inject a
dose of the same medicine into the wound at the same
time. Only a small proportion of the animals or persons
bitten by animals supposed to be rabid ever become mad.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.—<span class='sc'>Part IV.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE EYES, EARS, NOSE, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Eye, Ophthalmia</h4>

<p class='c010'>It may arise from a variety of causes, such as congestion
of the brain; exposure to heat and cold; over-exertion;
blows or other injuries; over-salted food, infection, foreign
bodies, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The white of the eye is covered with red
streaks; the clear portion in front (pupil) is dim; water
runs down the face; the light cannot be endured and the
eyelid is closed. An ulcer may appear afterwards in the
front of the eye, and it may go on until it penetrates
through the outer coating of the eye (cornea), and the
fluids of the eye thus escape. In some cases proud flesh
springs up from these ulcers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The A.A., should be given, a dose of two
drops only, two or three times per day. This in general
will be sufficient for all forms of ophthalmia; but if the
case is of some standing, or if ulcers or degenerations
have taken place, two drops of I.I., may be given every
night, and the A.A., in the morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>A wash of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, diluted
one-half with soft water, will promptly relieve.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Amaurosis, Gutta Serena</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease consists in entire or partial loss of vision
in consequence of paralysis of the optic nerve, or interruption
of its communication with the brain. Injuries of
the head, or ball of the eye, or some disease of the brain,
are the usual causes. The dog walks cautiously, head
elevated, the eye has a peculiar glassy appearance, and
the pupil does not dilate and contract when light is
brought near or removed from the eye.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>But little can be done for these cases. In the earlier
stages a dose of the A.A., may possibly arrest its progress,
but generally it is incurable in man or beast.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cataract</h4>

<p class='c010'>Opacity of the crystalline lens, or of its capsule, or
both, prevents the transmission of light, and thus causes
blindness. One or both eyes may be affected; old dogs
generally suffer in both. The causes are the same as
those which lead to cataract in the horse; and to the
section thereon reference should be made. But little can
be done by way of medicine; A.A., will sometimes relieve.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Pterygium</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease, which consists in a thickened state of the
cellular tissue of the conjunctiva, extending from the
inner angle of the eye towards the cornea, is not uncommon
in dogs, both old and young. In pups it is
often cured by the mother’s licking the eye; in old dogs
it proves intractable. It sometimes follows ophthalmia.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—You may give daily a dose, one to three
drops, of A.A., with decided benefit.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Eczema of the Eyelids</h4>

<p class='c010'>In this affection small pustules appear on the edges of
the lids at the roots of the lashes; presently they break,
emit matter, which drys into crusts, mats the hair, and
glues the lids together. If not arrested, the ulceration
extends and destroys the bulbs of the hair, and with
them the eyelashes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The eyelashes should be clipped off close
to the eyelids; the parts carefully washed with a sponge
and diluted <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, morning
and night, to prevent agglutination. When crusts have
formed they can be best softened and removed by fomentations
with warm water. Care should be taken not to
drag away the purulent matter with force. Give I.I.,
morning and night.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Fistula Lachrymalis</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lachrymal canals, which originate  from the
internal angle of the eye, convey the tears into the
lachrymal sac, an oval bag, which is a receptacle for
tears. It is situated near the angle, and constitutes the
upper extremity of the nasal duct. If this duct be
obstructed, the tears flow over on the cheek and a small
tumor forms in the sac. This is followed by inflammation,
suppuration, and the formation of an abscess, which
bursts externally and leaves a fistulous opening, through
which tears flow from the sac on to the cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Sponge the eye with warm water, and
give A.A., morning and night, if the eye or lids are
inflamed, or the I.I., if no manifest inflammation is
present.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Canker in the Ear</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease consists of an inflammation of the internal
ear, followed by ulceration and the formation of matter.
It is usually the consequence of some injury, but may
also result from excess of food and want of exercise, or
from frequent and sudden exposure, as in case of dogs
taught to go in the water, among whom it is quite
common; it may also come from parasites; fat dogs are
more subject to it than others.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The dog manifests pain by shaking his
head, scratching his ears, or whining. The internal ear
looks red, afterwards may ulcerate; a discharge occurs,
and a blackish fluid will be found at the bottom of the
ear, sometimes in considerable quantity; there is high
fever, which, with the continuance of the discharge, may
wear out the dog.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Wash the ear frequently with warm
water, to carefully remove the discharge; afterwards
apply some diluted <span class='sc'>Marvel Witch Hazel</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Give A.A., three or four drops, alternately with I.I.
The same dose four times per day; it may be successful.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Deafness</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—It is sometimes a sequel of distemper, fever,
or inflammation of the brain; it is also due to general
debility, an accumulation of hardened wax, old age
and canker.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Examination must be made to ascertain
if it is due to the impaction of hard wax; if so, a little
warm water and soap may be injected twice a day;
after a few days the wax will most likely be softened
sufficiently to allow of its removal. If the disorder
follows distemper, C.C., should be given; if fever or
inflammation of the brain, A.A.; if canker, also the
C.C., a dose morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Serous Cyst or Abscess of the Ears</h4>

<p class='c010'>This affection of the ear generally arises from some
injury, which is followed by an accumulation of a pale,
straw-colored fluid between the outside and inside skin of
the ear. Sometimes it increases slowly, at others rapidly,
so much so that in a few days there will be a quarter of
a pint deposited. The best thing is to open the swelling
at once with a lancet, at the lowest part of the inside of
the ear, and press out all the fluid. If this can be done
effectually, adhesion of the two skins takes place without
anything else being necessary. But if the discharge has
been caused by a severe blow, it may continue for a week
or two. Occasionally, if the punctured place is not kept
open, the fluid accumulates a second and third time; if
such should be the case, it will be advisable to inject a
little warm water, and lay the ear in a vessel containing
warm water for five or ten minutes, once a day for
several days. Give I.I., also morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>External Canker</h4>

<p class='c010'>External Canker is mostly found on the ears of dogs
with short coats; it comes generally on the outside of the
ears, beginning at the tips, and gradually extends down
to the roots.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Constitutional tendency; unsuitable food;
want of cleanliness; sudden disappearance of eczema.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—I.I., is the proper remedy, giving once
or twice per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ears should be washed once a day with warm
water and soap. After they are dry, the following lotion
should be applied with a sponge; Glycerine one part,
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span> two parts, to water
three parts.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ulceration of the Nose</h4>

<p class='c010'>Ulcerations of the nose are not common in dogs, but
they should not be neglected, as they might injure or
destroy the sense of smell. They sometimes occur in
old dogs, and emit a purulent, or sanious, and most
offensive discharge. This condition is attended with
pain, noisy breathing, attempts to sneeze, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—C.C., is the proper remedy, and may be
given two or three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nostrils should be washed and syringed with tepid
water, morning and night.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.—<span class='sc'>Part IV.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Angina—Sore Throat</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Inflammatory swelling of the larynx and
trachea.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Exposure to sudden cold when heated; damp
lodgings.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The first are generally sneezing, hoarse
cough, ears and nose alternately hot and cold, noisy
breathing, caused by swelling of the glands under the
throat and jaw; difficulty of swallowing. The front of
the neck, especially about the larynx, is much swollen;
when the swelling is considerable, internally and
externally, the breathing sometimes becomes so much
embarrassed that the animal dies of suffocation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A.A., a dose every hour at first,
and then every two hours, until relieved.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—The frequent application to the
throat of cloths dipped in hot water; cold water,
frequently renewed, for the dog to lap; cold milk and
broth as diet.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Catarrh—Coryza—Cold</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—As a rule, coryza in the dog consists of
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose. It
is most frequent among dogs that are petted and kept in
warm rooms. It may lead to bronchitis and other
diseases of the respiratory organs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Cause.</span>—Change of temperature, especially in spring,
during the prevalence of easterly winds.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Running from the nose and eyes; sneezing;
diminished appetite; accelerated breathing; dullness;
heaviness; sleepiness.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—C.C., is the proper remedy, a dose, one
to three drops, three or four times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Treatment.</span>—It will facilitate the cure if the
dog is kept in a warm place for a day or two, not allowed
to go out at all, and fed upon milk or thin oatmeal gruel.
He should also have plenty of water to drink. The nose
and eyes should be sponged with tepid water several
times a day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bronchitis—Acute and Chronic</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Acute bronchitis is active inflammation
of the membrane of the air-tubes of the lungs. Chronic
bronchitis more particularly affects old dogs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Sudden changes of temperature; standing in
the cold when heated; cold draughts of air in the
kennels, or wherever the dog is kept, frequently cause
bronchitis.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The first symptoms of acute bronchitis are
generally those of common cold; shivering; short, hard
cough; constant distressing cough, at first dry, afterwards
accompanied by a sticky mucous; feverish symptoms;
accelerated pulse and breathing; loss of appetite; dullness;
an anxious look depicted on the countenance.
Auscultation detects a wheezing sound, or rattling of
mucous, in the trachea and bronchial tubes. The nose is
hot and dry at the commencement of the attack, but
becomes moist when the inflammatory stage is passed.
Chronic bronchitis consists of a cough during the winter
months, which comes on after changes in the temperature,
and is attended with shortness of breath and
wheezing.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give, at first, and during the feverish
stage, a dose, of A.A., one to three drops, according to
the size of the dog. After the more urgent symptoms
have been relieved, E.E., may be given, in alternation
with the A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—The dog should be kept in the
house, and in one temperature, as nearly as possible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>A pail of boiling hot water may be placed in the kennel
from which the steam will evaporate and keep the air
moist; this will be found very beneficial. Milk, or bread
and milk, constitute the best diet; farinaceous food, but
no meat; fresh supplies of cold water. Meat broth may
be given in cases of great debility and old age.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Asthma</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease, which most nearly resembles broken wind
in the horse, is characterized by difficult breathing, with
intervals of free respiration.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Close confinement, want of outdoor exercise,
excessive feeding; it is observed almost wholly among fat
and petted dogs, from four to seven years old.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease is insidious in its invasion; it
begins with a slight cough, which returns at irregular
intervals, and is therefore likely to escape observation.
It, however, becomes more frequent and troublesome; is
harsh, dry and sonorous, and may give the mistaken
impression that there is a bone in the throat. It is then
provoked by every change of temperature, food or
posture; becomes almost incessant; disturbs sleep;
produces nausea and sickness; but nothing is expelled
besides mucus from the respiratory passages, where its
presence is a cause of irritation. Meanwhile the breathing
is affected, and is not unfrequently very labored and
painful. The digestion may be impaired; the appetite
slight or morbid; the breath offensive; the teeth covered
with tartar; the coat rough; the skin mangy. In some
cases the dog is worn down by the irritation of the cough;
in others the pulmonary congestion arrests respiration,
and causes suffocation; or cardiac difficulties cause
accumulation of blood in the head, and consequent
convulsive fits. But the disorder generally ends in
hydrothorax or ascites—generally the latter. In these
cases the body wastes, the abdomen is enlarged, the legs
swell, the coat is staring, the breathing very laborious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>till, ultimately, suffocation puts an end to the animal’s
existence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—If the disorder be treated judiciously in
the early stage, it is curable; but if it has continued for
any length of time, only palliation can be looked for.
Give E.E., a dose, according to size of dog, two or three
times per day. For a fit of asthma or bad breathing,
give A.A., every hour. For old, bad cases, try I.I.,
three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Exercise should be regularly taken
in the open air, except when the weather is cold, or
damp, or sultry. The food should be of the best and
most nutritious quality, given frequently, but in small
quantities at a time.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Chest, Pneumonia or Pleurisy</h4>

<p class='c010'>Inflammation of the chest usually involves both the
pleura or lining membrane of the chest, and the substance
of the lungs, so that they may be advantageously treated.
It is usually the result of cold and exposure after being
heated; it may also be produced by wounds.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Shivering chill, followed by heat and
thirst; the sides are painful when pressed upon; stitches
are observed; the dog sits upon his haunches, with the
fore legs separated from each other, and the head held
forward; the breath hot; cough short and painful; breathing
frequent, labored and heaving; pulse full and quick;
tongue hangs out of the mouth; eyes thrust forward and
red; finally drowsiness, and death. Sometimes the
effusion of water in the chest is very abundant, when the
legs swell, and breathing becomes difficult, labored and
suffocating.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give first, three or five drops, according to the size of the dog, of the A.A., and repeat the dose
every two hours for the first twenty-four hours. Then
alternate the E.E. with the A.A., at intervals of two
or three hours.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Cough</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In most cases cough is symptomatic of disease, and
often indicates the commencement of some serious disorder
of the respiratory organs, when it should not be
allowed to continue unheeded. Well fed dogs often have
a dry, searching cough, which, if they are old, degenerates
into asthma. Cough is sometimes consequent on
obesity, when the amount of food should be lessened,
exercise taken, and J.K., administered. If it be caused
by the dog going into the water, or being washed with
warm water in winter, or being confined for some time
in a low, damp situation, I.I., or E.E., are the remedies.
Such a cough is generally harsh and hard, and accompanied
by vomiting of tough mucus. A dose two or
three times per day is sufficient.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.—<span class='sc'>Part IV.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Salivation</h4>

<p class='c010'>Mercury, in its various forms, is sometimes given to
dogs by ignorant persons, or by chemists and dog-fanciers,
for some real or supposed disease; or it is
applied to them externally as an ointment for mange, in
either case resulting in salivation, with the following.—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Loss of appetite; sore, swollen gums,
which are blueish, easily bleed, and generally ulcerate;
loosened teeth, which may even fall out; constant
dribbling of saliva from the mouth; offensive breath;
swelled glands; extreme weakness; hair falls off; and
frequently purging, attended with straining.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the A.A., a dose each morning and
noon, and a teaspoonful of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch
Hazel</span> at night, especially if there is ulceration of the
mouth or throat. If not improved after three or four
days, substitute I.I., three or five drops, morning and
night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Canker in the Mouth</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is a very troublesome affection, and often difficult
to cure; indeed, if the disease be the result of a long continued
local irritation, or the dog be old, it is
generally considered to be incurable.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The gums are swollen, and discharge
purulent, bloody, offensive matter; “proud flesh” is
formed; bleeding ensues; there is difficulty in eating;
appetite and condition are lost; emaciation and exhaustion
follow.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—When the disease is of recent origin, or
the dog is young and generally healthy, the mouth
should be washed out once a day for several days, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>a solution of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, half
water; and give J.K., say three times per day, two to
three drops, according to the size of the dog. It is
usually promptly efficacious.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diseases of the Teeth</h4>

<p class='c010'>The teeth are more frequently affected in the dog than
in other domestic animals. This may be the result of a
variety of causes, among which are the following: Eating
or gnawing bones, by means of which the teeth may be
broken or ground down to the quick; healthy, well fed
dogs only pick their bones; rich, sweetened food, which
has an injurious effect upon the teeth; mercury, frequently
given to dogs, which produces salivation, loosening,
and eventually falling out of the teeth. Teaching
dogs to carry or chase hard substances, stones, etc.,
frequently results in diseased teeth, as they are thus
rubbed down to the gum, and the stump produces much
mischief.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—If the dog has a bad breath, seems to be
in pain when he eats, does not thrive or manifest his
usual spirit, the mouth should be examined. One or
more teeth will be found worn down to the gum; the
fang produces irritation, and may result in an abscess;
the sides of the mouth are raw and ulcerated, and saliva
dribbles from it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Extraction is the sole remedy for loose,
irregular or decayed teeth.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Indigestion</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Imperfect transformation of food into a
state suitable for the nourishment of the body.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Improper food, or food in too large quantities;
want of exercise.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Restlessness; partial loss of appetite; frequently
attempts to vomit, sometimes bringing up only
froth; at other times a mixture of froth and green
fluid; foulness of breath; irregular action of the bowels;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>distention of the body; lying out at full length and
rolling over; the appetite is vitiated or impaired.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the J.K., for indigestion, a dose,
one to three drops, according to the size of dog, once in
two, three or four hours. Often a dose night and morning
is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Attention to diet and regular
exercise go a long way towards curing and preventing
this disease.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Vomiting</h4>

<p class='c010'>It is such an easy matter for dogs to vomit that the
least thing which disagrees with the stomach occasions it.
It is rarely of any consequence, as it does not interfere
with the health; but there are some cases of continued
vomiting, in which it is necessary to administer medicine.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—When vomiting takes place daily for
several days, and soon after eating, it will most likely
be remedied by changing diet; if it continues after the
diet has been changed, give a dose of J.K., morning and
night. Should the dog be bloated or full of gas, a dose
of F.F., will be curative.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Colic</h4>

<p class='c010'>Colic is not unfrequent in the dog. It is often
connected with constipation, and may result from bad
food, sudden change of food, exposure to cold, or from
worms. It is common in puppies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The dog has sudden pain in the bowels; it
comes on in fits, is worse at one time than another. The
dog is restless, frequently changing his position; he
extends himself and then draws himself in with arched
back, turns his head towards his sides, throws himself
down, rolls about, moans or whines when the pain is
severe, with a short, rough voice. There is rarely any
fever in case of simple colic.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The F.F., should be given; a dose, from
three to five drops, according to the size of the dog, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>repeated every half hour or hour, as the urgency of the
case demands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should it not promptly relieve, the A.A., or J.K., may
be given alternately with F.F.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Gastritis—Inflammation of the Stomach</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Drinking cold water when heated from
running; damp kennels; continued feeding with rich
food; indigestion; poisons.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Great pain; the dog throws himself on the
ground, kicks and rolls; there is constant desire for cold
water, but as soon as any food or drink is swallowed,
it is rejected; constant retching; dry and hot nose; cold
extremities; quick breathing; anxious countenance;
lying on the belly on the coldest ground the dog can find.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A.A., is the proper medicine. Give a
dose as often as every hour if in great distress, and at
longer intervals as the patient improves. From one to
three drops, according to the size of dog.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Nothing but cold water should be
allowed till all the symptoms have disappeared; even
then great care must be exercised for several days, as to
the kind of food given; cold milk or oatmeal gruel will
then be suitable, in small quantities.</p>

<p class='c004'>The treatment of gastritis produced by poisons consists
in removing the poison from the system and neutralizing
its effect.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Enteritis—Inflammation of the Bowels</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Inflammation of the bowels, either of their
whole substance or only the inside or lining membrane.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Drinking cold water when heated; exposure
of petted dogs to cold; damp or sudden changes of
weather; keeping the kennels of chained dogs on a damp,
sunless situation; too long continuance of animal food;
flatulent colic; obstruction of the bowels from hardened
fæces, foreign bodies, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Violent pain, without cessation; great
tenderness of the abdomen, which is very hot; the pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>is often so severe that the poor animal throws himself
violently down, howls, springs up again, walks about for
a few seconds, throws himself down again, rolls over and
cries out; these actions are repeated until relief is
obtained, or, in fatal cases, till a short time before death
takes place. There is also aversion of food, constant
thirst, constipation, the excrement coming away in small,
hard pieces, during the first stage of the disease; the
evacuations afterwards become loose and bloody.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—A. A., is the proper remedy, a dose of
from one to three drops, in a spoonful of water or milk,
should be given, at first every half hour, then, as he
improves, every hour, and as improvement progresses, at
still longer intervals, until relief is obtained. Sometimes
interposing a dose of F. F., is beneficial, if there
are loose, bloody stools, or violent pain.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Fomentations of hot water should
be applied to the body, and continued till the symptoms
have abated; cold water given to lap; milk and broth
may be given when the severe symptoms have subsided.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diarrhea</h4>

<p class='c010'>Excess of food, bad food, exposure to cold and wet, as
well as a bilious condition, may induce diarrhea in the
dog. If slight it will cure itself. It usually manifests
itself by sickness, vomiting, thirst, discharges more frequent
and thinner than usual. If it continues, the
animal becomes thin, weak, does not eat his food, and
his breath becomes offensive.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The F. F., will be found effectual. Give
three or four drops, according to the size of the dog,
three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dysentery</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Thirst, purging of fluid mixed with small
pieces of dung, attended with severe straining and pain;
often the discharges are of mucus mixed with blood.
There is loss of strength and appetite, with rapid wasting.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the F. F., two to five drops, every
one, two or three hours, according to the urgency of the
case.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Constipation, or Bound Bowels</h4>

<p class='c010'>Constipation is more frequently observed than diarrhea
in a dog. It may be the result of a want of proper
exercise, improper food, or some disorder of the liver or
other part of the digestive system. It is manifested by
frequent unavailing efforts to evacuate, attended with
groaning, trembling or other manifestations of pain.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give J. K., three to five drops, according
to size of animal, three times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should this course not relieve, an injection of warm
soap and water should be given, and repeated, if necessary,
until the result is accomplished.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Worms</h4>

<p class='c010'>The entire animal kingdom is subject to numerous
parasites or entozoa. These have their abode either upon
the surface, or along the intestinal tract, or within the
cavities, or even in the more solid substances or muscles
of the body. They are found in all animals and fish—those
in apparent health as well as those that are sick—and
part they play in the economy of nature is confessedly
obscure. It is generally conceded that it is only in
peculiar or morbid conditions, or under a course of diet
and regimen unfavorable to health, that they multiply
or increase to such an extent as to become of themselves
a source of irritation and disease. It is under these
conditions that <span class='fss'>INTESTINAL WORMS</span> become the subject of
medical treatment.</p>

<p class='c004'>No animal is so subject or so frequently tormented by
worms as the dog. This is doubtless owing to his highly
artificial life and the great variety of food given him.
Intestinal worms are of four varieties; the first is the
Ascarides or round worm, white or light yellow in color
and common in puppies. The second is the Oxyaris
Vermicularis, known as the pin or thread worm and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>inhabiting the lower bowel. The third is the Tenia or
tape worm. The fourth is the Uncinaria Trigonocephalus
or hook worm.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—All worm symptoms are questionable,
except finding them in the discharges. Their existence
may be inferred if the dog has a short coat, bound bowels
or purging, turns of griping, wasting or fits.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—For the first two classes of worms there
are two systems of treatment. The first is to give a
Vermifuge; this kills the worms and expels them from
the system, however, it has done nothing to relieve the
morbid conditions that allowed the worms to accumulate
in the first place and they will return and have to be
expelled etc. The other system is to remove the morbid
conditions which allowed the worms to accumulate and
the system will then expel the worms of its own accord.
This is naturally a slower process than the first but its
effects are much more lasting. D. D. belongs to the
latter class of remedies.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Give</span> D. D., two to five drops, according to size of dog,
two or three times per day. Its continuance will not fail
to eradicate them from the system.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <span class='sc'>Tape Worm</span> consists of a head not larger than a
pin’s head, in which there are four sucking cups and
their armature; a neck, which is an inch or more in
length, very slender and without joints; and the body,
consisting of a long row of flat, ribbon like segments,
each of which in rectangular in shape and increasing in
size towards the caudal extremity. These segments have
each the male and female organ, and at the caudal
extremity the ripe eggs; there may be several hundred of
these segments, each half or three-quarters of an inch in
length, and the entire animal measure several yards.
From time to time, the lower segments or joints as they
are termed, ripen, and are pushed off, and appear in the
evacuations.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Hook Worm</span> or <span class='sc'>Uncinaria Trigonocephalus</span> is a
small thread like worm, from one-quarter to three-quarters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of an inch long, white, with a black line down
the body, the head has a bell shaped mouth provided
with six hook like teeth; by means of these hooks the
worm buries its head in the lining of the intestine from
which it sucks blood. These worms are quite prevalent
in the Southern States also in Southern Europe and Asia.
They are found more frequently in packs of hunting dogs
than in individual house dogs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease develops gradually with weakness
and wasting followed by colic and alternating
constipation and diarrhea. A discharge of bloody mucus
from the nose and swelling of the limbs is characteristic
of the disease. Death follows at a considerable interval.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Both the Tape Worm and the Hook
Worm are very tenacious parasites and are not expelled
by Homeopathic Remedies nor by the ordinary Vermifuge.
Oil of Chenipodium has lately come into prominence
as a Vermifuge for worms of all kinds; this is an
American drug commonly called “Worm Seed” and was
used by the Indians before the days of Columbus and
later was very popular among the Southern “Mammies”
for the elimination of round worms. It has lately
returned to favor particularly for the treatment of Hook
Worms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Oil can be obtained at any drug store, 16 drops is
the dose for a dog of 40 pounds or over, this should be
reduced in proportion to the weight of the dog. The dog
should be starved for at least 12 hours, preferably 24
hours; he should then receive three doses with intervals
of two hours between the doses. Two hours after the
last dose give a tablespoonful of castor oil with a teaspoonful
of chloroform (reduce in proportion to size
of dog).</p>

<p class='c004'>Be careful to give the medicine exactly according to
the directions. A Vermifuge is a drug that is strong
enough to kill or paralize the worms without killing or
paralizing the animal; however too large a dose, or, too
short an interval between the doses, or, too many doses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>may kill or paralize the animal as well as the worms.</p>

<p class='c004'>If during the treatment the dog appears unusually
depressed, stop the medicine and give castor oil to move
the bowels and strong hot coffee as a stimulant.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Thread Worms (Filaria Immitis)</h4>

<p class='c010'>These thread worms inhabit principally the heart,
lungs, and sometimes the throat and air-passages of the
dog. They are sometimes found in bundles, slowly
unrolling themselves when the part is cut open, or are
found stretched out along the surface.</p>

<p class='c004'>The characteristic symptom is a peculiar cough
exhibited by any movement, especially after sleeping,
ending in a violent effort to bring up something, emaciation,
difficult breathing. When affected, the dogs run
violently; they fall down, become stiff, insensible, and
after a time get up and renew the chase.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Gastro-Duodinal Catarrh—Jaundice</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is occasionally found in dogs, more
particularly in fat ones. It may be the result of excess
of food and deficient exercise, or exposure to cold or
moisture.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The dog vomits, at first a yellow fluid
which may afterward become greenish and have streaks
of blood in it, eats little and is thirsty, the white of the
eye, gums, lips and parts of the skin not covered with
hair are yellow; hence the name Jaundice or yellows.
He is sometimes hot, at others cold, the urine is dark
and the dung clay colored, is dull, sleepy, shrinks from
notice and becomes thin. These symptoms all increase
until the dog becomes thin as a skeleton and at last dies,
quite worn out.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the A.A., alternately with J.K., a
dose of three to five drops, according to the size of the
dog, every three or four hours, as the urgency of the case
may demand. Old cases of liver complaint simply
require a dose of J.K., morning and night.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Foreign Bodies in the Esophagus—Choking</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A dog sometimes swallows a bone or piece of gristle,
which sticks in his throat. He begins to cough, is restless,
cannot swallow, puts his paw to the side of his head
as if to pull something away; the eyes are red and
prominent; mucus escapes from the mouth and nose.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The mouth should be opened as wide as
possible, and warm water poured in till the dog vomits,
when the intruder may come away; or it may be removed
with a forceps. But if removal in this direction be
impracticable, an attempt may be made to push the
foreign body into the stomach with a piece of whalebone,
cane or willow, protected at the end with a piece of
sponge dipped in oil. If this fails, it will be necessary to
open the esophagus. If this tube has been injured, two
or three drops of arnica should be given in water, twice a
day. For several days, milk or soup diet only should be
given.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Nephritis</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—Inflammation of the kidneys sometimes
ending in an alteration of the secretions. It is not a very
common disease, but when it occurs it is very dangerous.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Exposure to cold and wet; seasoned food;
over-exertion; strains; injuries; the presence of calculus;
the administration of cantharides and turpentine in
excessive doses, or as a result of infectious diseases.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Tenderness of the loins; stiffness of the
hind legs, which are carried wide apart when moving;
hot and dry mouth and nose; great thirst; frequent
turning of the head toward the flanks; the urine is passed
in small quantities, with straining, highly-colored, like
blood, or thick and glairy; bound bowels; feces hard and
dry; sometimes vomiting; the appetite is lost; there is
disinclination to move, and when the dog is obliged to
stir the back is arched.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give H.H., from one to three drops,
according to the size of the dog, once in three hours at
first, and then at longer intervals as the animal improves.
A.A. may be sometimes called for as an intercurrent
remedy, or to give between doses of the H.H.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Cloths wrung out of hot water and
laid across the loins will be beneficial; nothing but milk
must be given for several days.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Bladder, Cystitis</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease, which is a very dangerous and painful
one, may be caused by stones in the bladder, injuries,
fall upon the bladder when it is full of water, or similar
accidents. As a result of infectious diseases, or diseases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of the kidneys, also too long retention of urine in the
bladder (dogs kept in the house too long).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Hot, dry skin; pain in the back and
flanks; thirst; no appetite; restlessness and signs of pain;
frequent attempts to pass water, in which either one or
only a few drops are passed at a time; the water may be
clear, or thick and mixed with blood.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give first two or three doses of the A.A.,
at intervals of two hours, then give the H.H., a dose of
three or five drops, according to the size of the dog, at
intervals of two to three hours, until entirely relieved.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Liquid diet should be given such
as milk or broth.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Gonorrhea, Gleet</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease, which is essentially an inflammation of
the urethra, generally arises from taking the disease by
connection with other animals that have it, or from
repeated acts of sexual connection, which induces
irritation, followed by a gleety, discharge; or it may
arise in a modified form from uncleanliness.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—Discharge from the internal surface of the
sheath and urethra, or canal through which the water
flows, consisting of matter having a yellowish or greenish
color, glueing together the parts or hair about them; the
surface looks red and angry, and is attended with swelling
and pain; there is frequent desire to pass water; sometimes
the swelling and pain are but slight.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give the H.H., a dose of three or five
drops, according to the size of the dog, four times per day.</p>

<p class='c004'>In old cases, a dose of the J.K., given nightly, will be
of decided benefit.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inversion of the Womb</h4>

<p class='c010'>This sometimes occurs after parturition, either from
disease of the womb, or from straining to void the
placenta. The treatment consists in carefully washing
the womb with tepid water, and then with the fingers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>(oiled) returning it to its proper position. The womb in
these cases is turned inside out, so that what is the inside
when in its proper position becomes the outside when it
protrudes from the vagina. Therefore, to replace it,
the pressure must be from the part furthest from the
vagina, and made with careful, gentle pressure. The
replacement is easily affected, especially if an assistant
holds the bitch up by the hind legs. After the organ is
replaced, a little <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span> may be
applied or poured into the vagina, and a dose or two of
A.A. given. Afterwards, if there are symptoms of
straining, the bitch must be made to stand or walk
about, and G.G., must be given.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Inflammation of the Teats</h4>

<p class='c010'>This generally comes on a few days after the bitch has
pupped. At first there will be found small lumps at the
base of the teats, which are very tender; the swelling
soon increases, and extends all around the teats; they
then become very hot, and of a deep red color. The
sucking of the pups causes so much pain that the bitch
refuses to allow it. When this is the case, the inflammation
soon extends over the whole udder, and if it be not
arrested, suppuration takes place, and an abscess forms at
the base of one or more of the teats.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A.A., a dose of one to three drops,
once in say three hours at first, then once in six hours,
and bathe the teats in <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>
or if cracked or very sore, apply <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary
Oil</span>, morning and night.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII.—<span class='sc'>Part IV.</span><br> <span class='c007'>DISEASES OF THE SKIN AND EXTREMITIES, AND MECHANICAL INJURIES</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c009'>Eczema—Surfeit—Blotch</h4>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Definition.</span>—A non-contagious, vesicular disease of
the skin, not occasioned by the presence of parasites,
but dependent on constitutional predisposition. It is
sometimes termed mange, but is distinguished from that
disease by the absence of <i>acari</i>. Foul mange is an
aggravated form of eczema.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Causes.</span>—Hereditary constitution; insufficient exercise;
gross diet; food too spare or too full in quantity, or
unwholesome in quality; close kennel; dirty bedding, too
hard or too luxurious a bed, etc. Flesh food will produce
it; so, also, will sleeping on barley straw.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The disease begins with irritation of the
skin, which causes the dog to be continually scratching;
from inflamed patches a serous fluid exudes, which mats
the hair and forms scabs; these fall off together, leaving
the skin bare, inflamed, red, and discharging a thin,
watery fluid. This fluid dries in thin scales, which cause
considerable irritation. The scabs and scales are scratched
and rubbed by the dog, and are thus aggravated till
pustular and vesicular eruptions give the appearance of
general ulceration. The patch usually occurs on the back,
at the root of the tail, outer surface of thighs or rump.</p>

<p class='c004'>In other cases, in fat, over-fed animals, the skin is
devoid of hair, is greatly thickened (especially along the
back or before the tail), and is almost devoid of sensation.
The dog is very foul, and smells very offensively; the
skin is wrinkled, chapped, cracked, ulcerated, emitting
disgusting serum or pus; thick, yellowish crusts are
formed; and the dog lies dull all day long, sleeping,
licking, scratching, biting its sore places, a disgusting
object to look at.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>The disease may be confined to certain parts, when it
receives the name of the part attacked. In sporting
dogs there is frequently an eczematous eruption between
the toes and at the roots of the nails, which causes redness,
swelling and tenderness of the feet, together with
lameness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Puppies almost invariably inherit the disease when it
has occurred on one of the parents.</p>

<p class='c004'>As it is a constitutional disease, its duration is uncertain,
its cure difficult, and its return probable.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—In old cases, give the I.I., each morning,
and the J.K., at night, and anoint, once per day, the
sore, rough or scabby places, with <span class='sc'>Zinc Ointment</span>. In
urgent recent cases, the remedies above referred to may
be given, four doses in a day. But in general the treatment
first named will suffice.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Accessory Means.</span>—Strict attention must be given to
diet; flesh must be utterly prohibited, except in the case
of weak puppies, or when the disease has occasioned
great debility, and then broth will be better than solid
flesh. To gross dogs a few days’ abstinence will do no
harm; they may thus become willing to take boiled rice,
which should be offered fresh every day; but if declined,
withdrawn at once. If the dog refuse to eat more than
three days, an ounce or two of meat (according to his
size) may be given to keep him alive, without satisfying
his hunger. Vegetable or farinaceous food should still
be offered sparingly, and when taken, the morsels of flesh
should be discontinued. Do no more washing than is
necessary. Dirt scabs, etc., should be removed with
olive oil. The dog’s bed should be repeatedly changed,
and his kennel well ventilated; he should have free,
moderate exercise in the open air, and be fully supplied
with fresh water.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Boils—Furuncles</h4>

<p class='c010'>Boils, which may appear on any part of the body, are
small, round, red, hard, painful tumors, with raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>centers, from which they supperate. When ripe, the
boil should be opened and the pus pressed out. Warm
fomentations will hasten the ripening.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Give A.A., a dose three times per day,
one to three drops, according to the size of the dog. If
the boil is red and painful, apply <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary
Oil</span>, two or three times per day. The boils should
be opened when they have come to a head.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Louse—Tick—Flea</h4>

<p class='c010'>The dog louse (<i>trichodectes latus</i>), the dog tick (<i>irod
ricinus</i>), and the dog flea (<i>pulex canis</i>) are sources of no
little torment. They cause considerable irritation, which
induces the dog to scratch and rub himself; small
pimples are formed, their heads are rubbed off, serum
exudes, perhaps matter, and thus sores are produced.
Lice are found in every part of the body, but particularly
on the head and about the eyes and lips. They do
not live on man. Ticks do not infest house dogs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Fleas are best removed by means of
Persian Insect Powder (Flores Pyrethri), this may be
dusted on the dog or better dissolved in alcohol or water
and sprinkled or rubbed on, another convenient way is
to dust on the powder after a bath and before the hair
has entirely dried. As this powder renders the fleas
insensible rather than killing them, means should be
taken to prevent the fleas getting back on the dog after
they have recovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>For house dogs a convenient way is to stand the dog on
newspapers while dusting on the powder and hold him
there for a few minutes until the fleas have dropped off;
then carefully gather up the papers and burn them.</p>

<p class='c004'>For larger dogs in the country the powder may be
dusted on out-doors and away from stables, kennels, etc.,
and the dog kept out until the fleas have left him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sleeping quarters of the dog must also be carefully
attended to, the box or basket should be washed with
creoline or lysol solution or may be washed with water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and dusted with the powder while still damp; the bedding
should be washed in boiling water if possible or if a
pillow is used it may be placed in an oven sufficiently
hot to kill the fleas but not hot enough to scorch pillow.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the dog is very young or feeble brush the powder off
after it has been on for 15 minutes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lice and ticks are readily killed by Kerosene (Coal Oil).
For small house dogs, Spirit of Anise or Oil of Anise, with
10% of Olive Oil, is probably a better remedy. Any of
these should be applied night and morning, for two days
and then washed off. Then the dog should be carefully
combed to remove the eggs which adhere to the hair paying
particular attention to the face, around the eyes etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>Do not attempt to pick lice or ticks off dogs, as very
often the head remains in the skin, causing a small sore.
Wait until the application has killed him and he will
drop off. The bedding should be treated as for fleas.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Mange</h4>

<p class='c010'>Mange differs from eczema in being contagious and
caused by parasites. The eruption in each case looks the
same to the layman; however mange usually comes on
those parts of the body where the hair is short and the
skin tender, such as, the head, chest and abdomen, the
inside of the thigh. White eczema usually does the
opposite and attacks the back and outer parts, where the
hair is long and the skin thick.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The acari must be killed by an external
application of some sort, Creoline or lysol are excellent,
these may be bought at any drug store, and diluted
according to the directions on the bottle. For small
house dogs, Peruvian Balsam is undoubtedly the best
application, but it is expensive; any of these should be
applied twice a day for several days, means should be
taken to keep the dog from licking off the ointment.</p>

<p class='c004'>In addition, give the I.I., three to five drops, night
and morning, to relieve the itching and promote a
healthy growth of hair and skin.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Sore Feet</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>These may be occasioned by injuries, long traveling
over rough and frozen ground, or in very dry weather.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The foot is swelled, and small, hard,
painful lumps are felt in it; there is much pain, and
the animal cannot bear its weight upon them. The skin
becomes red, and the nails fall off. There is usually
considerable fever and no desire to eat.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Bathe the feet three or four times per
day in <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel Witch Hazel</span>, or apply
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>, and give, morning and
night, a dose of three or five drops of A.A.</p>

<p class='c004'>If matter forms, a poultice may be applied, and the
abscess afterwards opened.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fractures</h4>

<p class='c010'>Simple fractures of the leg are very readily cured in
young and vigorous dogs. It may be readily known by
the distortion of the limb, by the ends of the bone
grating upon each other, lameness, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment</span> is very simple. Extend the limb and put
the bones in place, and apply splints with a firm
bandage, wetting the limb with <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel
Witch Hazel</span>. Examine them from time to time to see
that they are kept in place. After three or four weeks
they may be removed, and the animal trusted to use its
limbs. Give B.B., night and morning, for a few days,
three or five drops, according to the size of the animal.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Hemorrhage</h4>

<p class='c010'>Occasionally dogs discharge blood from the nose, mouth
or anus, after a long run, after going uphill, or after
blows or other external injuries. Consideration should
be given to the specific cause. Arnica, internally and
externally, will often be found curative, or a dose of A.A.
For an alarming hemorrhage, give a spoonful of
<span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Marvel, Witch Hazel</span>, and repeat it every
hour if necessary.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='c007'>PART V.</span><br> Diseases of Swine and Hogs</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Hogs have at times been known to have practically all
of the diseases common to other domestic animals.
However, in spite of unsanitary surroundings and
manner of life, these diseases are very rare, and (in the
United States) when a hog gets sick it probably has hog
cholera.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>Hog Cholera</h4>

<p class='c010'>There are two forms of hog cholera, the acute, and the
chronic: however, since the only difference of importance
is the length of time the disease takes to kill the
hog, it is not worth while to try to decide which form it is.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The hog has fever; appears dull and sleepy;
lies down and does not want to rise or move about;
the eyes are red and bloodshot, with a discharge which
often glues the eyelids together; and a watery diarrhea.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—There is no known cure for hog cholera;
prevention is the only thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this respect the serum gotten up by the U. S.
Department of Agriculture has done more than anything
else to eradicate the disease.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are two methods of inoculating the hog, the
single and the double.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the double method the anti-toxin is injected into
the hog and also a quantity of the disease germs, this
produces a lasting immunity.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the single method the anti-toxin alone is used,
this only produces a transient immunity unless the hog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>is soon after exposed to the disease, in which case the
immunity becomes lasting.</p>

<p class='c004'>The single method should be used where cholera has
already broken out in a herd, to protect the animals
which have not yet acquired the disease; in all other
cases the double method should be used.</p>

<p class='c004'>A farmer should not attempt to give the serum
unless he has had considerable experience with it and
seen competent people properly administer it; otherwise
call in a Veterinarian, his charges will be less than the
value of the hogs that would otherwise be lost.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='c021'>PART VI.</span><br> Diseases of Poultry</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c007'>Doses and Methods of Preparing the Remedies for Use.</span></h3>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>One drop</span> or <span class='fss'>PART</span> of a <span class='fss'>DROP</span> is quite sufficient as a
dose for an ordinary fowl. One drop of any remedy put
into a teaspoonful of water or milk, and this put into a
teacup so as to <i>be thoroughly mixed</i>, is a sufficient dose for
<span class='fss'>FIVE FOWLS</span> of full size, or ten chickens.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Where a flock</span> or several fowls are to be treated, drop
ten drops of the proper remedy into a cup, to which add
ten teaspoonfuls of water, milk or curdled milk, and
after <i>stirring it thoroughly</i> with a perfectly clean spoon,
mix this with the meal, grain or bread, or whatever food
is given them. If the quantity of fluid should not be
sufficient to properly moisten the food, more can be
added without detriment, provided the mass be <i>thoroughly
stirred and mixed</i> before wetting the food. This would be
enough for fifty fowls. Some will get more and some
less, of course; but each will probably get enough to
answer a curative purpose, and none will get so much as
to be injurious.</p>

<p class='c004'>If a bird is so ill as not to eat or drink, and the
Remedy must be given by hand, the mouth may be
gently opened and two or three drops of the mixture,
made in the proportion of one drop of the Remedy to
a <i>teaspoonful</i> of water, may be turned down, or the fluid
may be turned on soft food and thus given, at the intervals
mentioned under each separate disease.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Bread soaked in milk or water</i>, cooked cracked wheat or
curdled milk is, in general, the best food for sick or
ailing fowls.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Aspergillosis—Brooder Pneumonia</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease affects both the adult birds and the young
chickens often causing serious loss among the latter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disease is caused by a fungus or mold which grows
on straw, grain, etc., and is either inhaled in breathing
or swallowed by the chicken; it sticks to the air passages
and grows there as it did on the straw or grain, in small,
yellow patches.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—In the adult fowl, the first symptoms are
apt to pass unnoticed, these are loss of appetite and
increased thirst, then the fowl loses weight; the breathing
becomes labored and is accompanied by a rattle in the
throat from the mucus which collects. This keeps on
getting worse until the bird dies.</p>

<p class='c004'>In young chickens the first symptoms are a sleepy and
lifeless appearance and drooping wings. This is followed
by rapid breathing and rattle in the throat and white
diarrhea, which may be mistaken for the disease of that
name (see page <a href='#Page_269'>269</a>).</p>

<p class='c004'>This disease may be mistaken for Anemia or Tuberculosis
in the adult, or White Diarrhea in the chicken,
and the only sure way is to kill a bird and examine the
air passages and lungs; which will be found covered with
patches of white or greenish-yellow membrane.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—There is no cure for this disease and we
must rely on prevention. Kill all affected birds and
thoroughly disinfect the quarters, and be very careful
not to give moldy grain or use moldy straw.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Blackhead</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is particularly destructive to young turkeys
when from 2 weeks to 4 months old. Other domestic
fowls probably carry the disease without being themselves
affected.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disease is caused by a very small animal known as
an amoeba and much too small to be seen by the naked
eye. These amoeba are swallowed in eating or drinking
and make their way to the spot where the large and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>small intestine join. At that point there are two blind
pouches, and the amoeba stick there and increase and
multiply, until the intestine is almost completely obstructed;
they also pass to the liver which becomes covered with
yellowish or yellowish-green spots. From the position in
the intestine the amoeba pass out with the excrement to
infect more turkeys.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The young turkeys appear dull and listless,
and do not follow the flock, and seem to have lost
interest; the wings droop and the bird gets weaker and
weaker; diarrhea is present and often a peculiar discoloration
of the head which gives the name “blackhead”.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—So far no successful cure has been found
for this disease, and we must rely on prevention.
Diseased birds should be killed at once, their bodies
burned and the runways, houses, etc., thoroughly disinfected.
Turkeys should not be confined with other
domestic fowls, for while these do not suffer from
“blackhead” they are believed to carry it.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bronchitis</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is known by the frequent coughing, and if observed, a
more frequent respiration than in health, and generally
a well marked rattling in the throat may be noticed.
In the more advanced stage there is discharge, as in
catarrh, or a slight discharge as it gets well. Give the
A.A., two or three times per day.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Bumble Foot</h4>

<p class='c010'>Occurs mostly in the large breeds of fowls, and is
supposed to be caused by bruising the foot when alighting
on a hard surface, or in resting on a small or uneven
perch. There is a swelling or corn in the bottom of the
foot, which softens, becomes ulcerated, forming a putrid
surface or sore. Remove the putrid or decayed matter
carefully, and paint with iodine; this may be repeated
two or three times, and give, internally, the J.K., or if
the foot is hot and swelled and not yet maturated, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>A.A., may dissipate the swelling without its maturating.
The bird should be kept on the straw and not suffered to
rest on the perch.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Cholera</h4>

<p class='c010'>Usually makes its appearance as a diarrhea, with frequent
greenish droppings and violent thirst, and extreme
weakness and rapid failing of strength; the birds staggering
or falling about, and often attacks of cramps. There
is generally also an anxious look in the face. The disease
is sometimes rapidly fatal, death occurring in one or
two days.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is generally admitted to be caused by confining too
many birds in close, limited quarters; insufficient shade;
stale, unhealthy drinking water; exposure to the hot sun;
feeding on grass-runs covered with droppings, and the
want also of a regular supply of fresh green food. The
disease rarely or never occurs where fowls have a liberal
range, clean runs, good water and green food daily.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The flock should at once be removed
from their unhealthy surroundings, and be given a clear,
ample range, and the F.F., every three hours in urgent
cases, or three times per day to those who are yet able to
eat. The yards should be scraped free of droppings and
covered with clean earth. Disinfect pens with 5%
carbolic acid or fumigate with sulphur and whitewash
with 5% carbolic in the whitewash.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Tuberculosis</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is sometimes observed in fowls, manifested by
wasting of flesh and great weakness, notwithstanding
good feed. The disease is incurable and affected birds
should be killed at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>In large flocks in close quarters where a few of the
birds have it, it will usually be found that all have it,
and it may be cheaper in the long run to destroy the
entire flock, thoroughly disinfect the entire premises and
stock up over again.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Cramps</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Chickens are sometimes subject to this disease,
especially in damp, cold weather. The toes are first
seen to be bent under, and by degrees they walk on the
knuckles or outside of the foot, and the birds often squat
on the hock. If it is the result of a cold, and the
chickens are feverish, as is generally the case, remove
them to a comfortable place, and give them the A.A.,
three times per day. If it fails after a day or two, try
the J.K. If the toes are badly cramped, they may be
washed in warm water and gently opened and kneaded
by the fingers, and afterwards be wiped dry.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Crop Bound</h4>

<p class='c010'>This is caused by the bird gorging itself with grain,
tough meat or bone, too large to be digested. When the
crop is so distended with hard food or other substance,
the outlet is narrowed or entirely closed, so that mechanical
manipulation may be necessary to cause its passage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where the crop is distended with hard food, and is
not passing off, and help is required, pour some milk-warm
water down the throat, and then, holding the head
downward, quietly manipulate or knead the distended
crop with the hand, so as to soften the mass. After the
mass has thus been carefully softened, pour down a
large teaspoonful of castor or sweet oil, and the mass
will be gradually worked off. Food should not be allowed
for some time. Give also the J.K., two or three times a
day, which may be continued to entire recovery. In
many cases the use of the J.K., will be successful without
the use of any other means.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Diarrhea and Dysentery (Scouring)</h4>

<p class='c010'>Is not uncommon among fowls, caused usually by
improper food or sudden changes of weather, or severe
exposure. In diarrhea the droppings are only too frequent,
watery, scalding or excessive, with consequent
drooping and wasting of flesh; while, if this condition is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>unchecked, the discharges become bloody or mingled
with blood and mucous, forming a real <i>dysentery</i>. This
latter form of the disease is said to be contagious, and
requires that the diseased birds should be separated from
the flock and the dead ones buried deeply, far away
from the yards or pens of the flock, and the yards and
pens thoroughly disinfected or use new ones. The
treatment is the same; the F.F., should be given, three
or four times per day. The food should be boiled milk
thickened with flour, and well cooked, or good bread
softened in scalded milk. Of course the birds should
have a clean, dry and well littered and sheltered place.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Egg Bound</h4>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes hens are unable to drop the egg from its
unusual size. This is usually manifested by the hens
coming off the nest and moping around with the wings
down and in evident distress. A large spoonful of castor
or olive oil often relieves, to which should be added a
dose of G.G. Should this fail after an hour, bathe the
vent with warm water, and then with a feather dipped in
oil, lubricate or freely oil the passage or viaduct, taking
care not to break the egg. Should the egg passage be
ruptured or protruded, the I.I., may be given, one or
two doses, to promote the healing.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Scaly Legs</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease is caused by a little mite which gets on the
chickens legs and burrowing under the skin and scales
causes the legs to become enlarged and the scales very
prominent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—The best application so far tried seems to
be an ointment composed of 1 part oil of caraway and 5
parts white vaseline, this should be rubbed on the legs
every few days until the disease disappears. The mites
can also be killed by putting a teaspoonful of kerosene
oil in a quart measure of water and dipping in the foot.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>However there is more danger of irritation than with
the oil of caraway, and very much so if any of the oil
gets on the feathers.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Feather Eating</h4>

<p class='c010'>This unnatural appetite, mostly observed in the hen, is
the expression of some chemical want in the system,
which, not satisfied in the food or drink of the fowl,
manifests itself in picking and eating the feathers.
Whatever supplies this want will relieve the expression
of it, or, in other words, the habit. To this end the
birds should have good feed and a grass run, if possible.
If not, fine grass should be chopped up and given them,
as also green food. <i>Bones</i> should be burned in the fire,
then pounded small and put within their reach. This will
supply the carbonate of lime, should that be wanting, and
an occasional feed of wet-up bran will supply the silex,
should the desire arise from deprivation of that. Some
animal food, well peppered, may also be used advantageously.
Give also the J.K., morning and night.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Fractures</h4>

<p class='c010'>Broken wings or legs in fowls may be set without much
trouble, if the fractured ends of bones are brought
together and secured. The leg or thigh may be held
straight, with the broken ends neatly in position, and a
rag, or even paper wet in white of egg, carefully wrapped
around it several times. The white of egg hardens as it
dries, and furnishes a sufficient protection until the callus
is formed. Broken wings are best secured by tying the
feathers firmly together about an inch from the end,
after having put the fractured ends neatly in place.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Frost Bites</h4>

<p class='c010'>If the comb or wattles are frost bitten, they should be
at first rubbed with snow or icy cold water, until the
natural color and suppleness is restored, and then an
application of <span class='sc'>Humphreys’ Veterinary Oil</span>. Two or
three applications will usually suffice.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Gapes, or Throat Worms</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This disease is so called from the peculiar action of the
chickens who are affected with it. It is caused by the
presence of a pale reddish worm, some three-quarters of
an inch in length, which infest the mouth and throat,
and of which from two to a dozen are found in a chicken,
each usually doubled up. These worms are a species of
pin worms, and have been bred in damp earth, and
hence are found among chickens which are <i>bred in damp,
moist soils</i>, and are rarely ever known when the birds
have a <i>clean, high or gravel yard</i>. The spawn of these
worms are deposited by myriads in the moist, unclean
soil, are thrown out by the coughing and efforts of the
ones infected, and becomes developed in the most barren
soil or in water, and thence transplanted to the crop with
the feed, become developed in the throat of the chick.
This is the most recent position of scientific knowledge
on this subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>The best method of treatment is to remove, where
possible, the chickens to a dry locality, and to give them
the D.D., morning and night. <span class='sc'>Feed the fowls</span> and
chicks with <i>finely chopped</i> <span class='fss'>ONIONS OR GARLIC</span> (<i>tops and
bottoms</i>,) <i>mixed with their food</i>. Experience shows the
good results of this thoroughly scientific—as well as
practical treatment. To remove the worms from the
throat, make a loop of one or two horse hairs, which
thrust down the throat, and with a slight twist draw it
out, bringing the worms with it. This may be repeated
until the throat is cleared. Or a quill feather, stripped
to within an inch or two of its end, may be dipped in a
mixture of glycerine or oil, and petroleum, made in the
proportion of three parts of oil or glycerine, to one part
of petroleum. Dip the feather in the mixture, and in
like manner pass it into and well down the throat, and
with a twist bring it out with the worms adhering. The
used feathers and remaining oil <i>should be burned</i> to destroy
the larvæ of the worms, and fresh feathers used freely,
so as not to spread the worms or their larvæ.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Gout or Rheumatism</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>May be distinguished by the birds being lame, walking
with difficulty and sitting about, and on examination the
legs or thighs will be found hot and feverish; or in cases
of longer standing, there will be evident stiffness of the
joints and weakness of the legs, and in some cases
contraction of the toes, which indicate cramps. The
bird should be kept in a comfortable, dry place, and the
B.B., given it three times a day. It is produced by
exposure to cold and wet, or to sudden change of
temperature.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Leg Weakness</h4>

<p class='c010'>In large breeds of fowls, and especially when being
bred “in and in,” so that the stamina of the system is
lowered, there is a deficient growth of bony matter, and
the birds are weak, squatting around or walking on their
hocks. It may be remedied by giving the J.K., morning
and night, and bones or oyster shells should be burned
in the fire, and then pounded small, and the dust
occasionally mixed with the food or placed where the
fowls have access to it. This will increase the deposit of
ossific matter and impart strength to the legs.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Giddiness</h4>

<p class='c010'>Which is liable to occur in over-fed birds, if suffered
to continue, may result in apoplexy. A dose or two of
the A.A., will equalize the circulation and remove the
difficulty and danger.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Lice</h4>

<p class='c010'>The symptoms of lice are too well known to require
description. Where fowl have ample range and well
ventilated, sunny coops, the fowl will usually keep fairly
clear of lice, particularly if they can find a sandy spot
for a dust bath.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>However, if a flock becomes badly infested, measures
must be taken to kill the lice on the individual birds.
This is best done by sprinkling powder on the bird.
Pyrethrium powder commonly called Persian Insect
Powder, is good, or, the following powder is recommended
by the Maine Experiment Station, as being the most
effective, yet cheapest, that they have been able to find.</p>

<p class='c004'>Take 3 parts gasoline and 1 part cresol, mix these
together and add gradually with stirring enough plaster
of paris to take up all the moisture.</p>

<p class='c004'>Either of these powders should be dusted on the
chicken, particularly around the vent, the under side of
the body and beneath the wings.</p>

<p class='c004'>For young chicks greasing is usually better than dusting.
Use either lard, or better, lard and sulphur. This
should be applied by the finger, to the head, neck, under
the wings and around the vent.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Indigestion—Loss of Appetite</h4>

<p class='c010'>If, as sometimes happens in consequence of over-feeding
or the use of too highly seasoned food, fowls lose
their appetite, and the digestion and thrift is impaired, a
change to soft, well cooked food, and the use, night and
morning, of the J.K., will soon correct the difficulty.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Liver Disease</h4>

<p class='c010'>There are several different diseases that affect the liver,
but since the external symptoms, causes and treatment
are the same for all of them, it is of no practical value
to differentiate between them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Liver disease is caused by insufficient exercise, confinement
in damp quarters, and too rich feed. Therefore it
is not so common in Summer and Fall, and is most
common in the Spring after the fowl have been more or
less confined during the winter.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The fowl die often with little apparent
reason, but on examination the liver will be found either
too large or too small, or in other unnatural condition.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—Plenty of open air exercise, with green
feed will gradually get the flock back in shape, except
perhaps for a few in which the disease has already gone
too far to stop it.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Moulting</h4>

<p class='c010'>We should take into consideration the great drain
upon the system of fowls in moulting. Not only are the
ordinary wastes of the body to be maintained, but the
old summer coat of feathers is to be discarded and an
entirely new one to be produced, involving in its growth
all the essential elements of which the feathers are
composed. If these substances—lime, carbon, sulphur,
silex, etc.—are not to be had in the food provided for
them, or are imperfectly produced or eliminated, the
work drags and the organism suffers, and waste of flesh,
poverty of the system or illness is the result. Hence it is
a wise precaution, during the season of moulting, to
allow the flock a more generous supply of food, and of
better quality than usual, and to exercise more than
ordinary care in housing and shelter. Fowls that have
fair feed and a reasonable range will rarely require
special care, but those confined are more apt to suffer.
Any stimulating food is of advantage. Hemp seed is
very beneficial, and iron is invaluable. An <i>acetate</i> of <i>iron</i>
may be readily made by putting some nails or other bits
of iron in <i>cider</i>. This, after standing a day or two, may
be used in mixing the feed. More cider may be added
as required, and so the cider and iron may be kept and
used during the entire moulting season. The I.I., is the
proper remedy, and should also be given two or three
times per week, or even more frequently if the birds are
suffering much.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little care and attention in this respect will shorten
the period of moulting and bring the birds out in better
health and vigor and better plumage.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Pip or Chirp</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Young chickens are affected by a peculiar form of
disease termed pip or chirp, from the short, spasmodic
chirups which they make during the complaint. The
chickens mope about uttering this peculiar cry, and seek
refuge in solitary places, as it is the instinct of animals
and birds to pick at, maim or destroy the sick or maimed
among them. The chicken is hot and feverish, although
trembling violently, and they are extremely tender on
being handled, and soon a dark-colored, dry, horny
scale will be found at the end of the tongue, and the
beak may turn yellow at the base; the appetite fails and
the plumage becomes ruffled, and they gradually sink
and die. It is doubtless caused by exposure to wet
weather, as the light down is easily saturated, and is
long in drying. The A.A., may be given at first, one or
two doses, and afterwards the J.K., three times per day.
The removal of the scale at the end of the tongue is of no
consequence. That is not the cause of the disease, but
the result, and the tongue will come all right so soon
as the chick is restored in his circulation and digestion.
Of course the birds should be well housed and fed on
soft food.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Roup</h4>

<p class='c010'>Almost all forms of chronic catarrh in fowls go by the
name of roup. It usually begins as a severe cold, caused
by exposure to cold, wet and damp. There is discharge
from the nostrils, at first of thin mucus, and which soon
becomes opaque, and even offensive, and the entire
cavity of the nose may become filled up; froth and
mucus fill the inner angle of the eye, the lids are swelled
and often the eye-ball quite concealed, and in severe
cases the entire face is considerably swelled. It is said
to be contagious, but is probably only so in extremely
virulent cases. But the fact that a flock of fowls are
exposed to similar disease-making conditions, and that
many are taken nearly at the same time, would countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the idea of its contagious character. The causes
of the disease should be avoided by providing shelter for
chickens during the cold, chilly, fall nights, and not
permitting them to wander around without feed in the
cold, raw mornings. A plentiful supply of nourishing
food and comfortable shelter when sudden cold changes
of weather occur, will do much to prevent the appearance
of this disease and the consequent loss. The iron and
cider with the food will be useful, and onions cut up fine
and mixed in the soft feed, is also an invaluable agent
for fowls affected with any form of roup. The A.A., is
the proper remedy, two or three doses at first, during the
inflammatory stage. Then the C.C., is the proper
remedy, and may be relied upon. Give it as often as
three, or even four times per day, in extreme cases. Of
course the severe cases should be well housed, have warm
and dry lodgings, free from exposure to open windows
and cold drafts of air, as the bird is liable to new chill
from fresh exposure. Washing the head and syringing
out the nose, and washing the throat with salt and
vinegar, or even with water and castile soap, is rarely
necessary and really of very little consequence. As the
catarrh passes off, the secretions will become healthy
and natural, and all these discharges disappear.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Soft Eggs</h4>

<p class='c010'>May be a sign of over-feeding, but are more commonly
from the want of material of which to form the shell—lime,
starch, sulphur, etc. The flock should have an
occasional feed of mashed potatoes and lime; old mortar;
burnt oyster shells, pounded up, should be placed in
reach. An occasional dose of J.K., will be beneficial.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>White Diarrhea</h4>

<p class='c010'>This disease probably causes more loss among newly
hatched chicks than all other diseases combined. It
attacks chicks when from 1 to 3 weeks old, and usually
when the chicks are over 3 weeks old they are safe from it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>White Diarrhea is caused by a germ, and when a flock
have this disease, it will be found that some of the chicks
were born with this disease and gave it to the others.</p>

<p class='c004'>When a flock of chicks have this disease, most of them
will die, but a few live through, and it is found that
these few who live through are the ones that carry the
disease. The germs in this case resides in the ovaries
and are in every egg such a hen lays. The chicks
hatched from these eggs develop the disease and communicate
it to the others.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Symptoms.</span>—The chicks appear stupid and remain
under the hen most of the time as if cold; they do not
run around with the others but remain by themselves.
The feathers are rough and the wings droop. They lose
weight and eat little or nothing. A white diarrhea
appears from which the disease gets its name; this is
usually creamy, but sometimes there is a little brown in
it. This discharge is sticky and sometimes even plugs
up the vent. The chick will often utter a shrill cry,
apparently of pain when voiding.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Treatment.</span>—No satisfactory cure has yet been found
for this disease and we must rely on prevention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where eggs are hatched under a hen, if one of a
setting develops this disease, the entire setting should be
killed and the nest and quarters of the setting disinfected.</p>

<p class='c004'>In using incubators, the eggs should be taken on the
18th day and placed in wire trays or baskets, holding
about 12 eggs each, and after the chicks are hatched
they should remain in these trays until 48 hours old,
then any trays that have developed the disease should
be destroyed.</p>

persistently four times a day, it relieves the sneezing,
lacrymation and asthma; and <i>by its continued use, from

<p class='c004'>Moderation in the use of coffee and tobacco; avoidance
of exposure; keeping warm and using only light and
easily digestible food, will greatly aid the beneficent

<p class='c004'>They are <span class='fss'>DEAR AT ANY PRICE</span>, always a delusion and a snare,

the reputation of the original. The few cents saved in the price
of a bottle, often costs the life of a valuable animal. It it is
worth using at all, it is worth getting the original and best, instead
of an imitation. You are only safe in buying HUMPHREYS’
